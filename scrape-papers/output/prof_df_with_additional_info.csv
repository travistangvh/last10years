Student skill and goal achievement in the mapping with google MOOC,2014,Full Paper,Student Skills and behavior,"Students who registered for the Mapping with Google massive open online course (MOOC) were asked several questions during the registration process to identify prior experience with eleven skills as well as their goals for registering for the course. Students selected goals from a list; they were periodically reminded of these goals during the MOOC. At the end of the course, we compared students' self reports of goal achievement on a post-course survey with behavioral click-stream analysis. In addition, we assessed how well prior skill in a subject predicts a student's course completion and found no correlation. Our research shows that students who completed course activities were more likely to earn certificates of completion than peers who did not.",,,,,,100,Student skill and goal achievement in the mapping with google MOOC,Wilkowski J.; Deutsch A.; Russell D.M.,"Wilkowski, Julia (56145762800); Deutsch, Amit (55790398700); Russell, Daniel M.

Correlating Skill and Improvement in 2 MOOCs with a Student’s Time on Tasks,2014,Full Paper,Student Skills and behavior,"Because MOOCs offer complete logs of student activities for each student there is hope that it may be possible to find out which activities are the most useful for learning. We start this quest by examining correlations between time spent on specific course resources and various measures of student performance: score on assessments, skill as defined by Item Response Theory, improvement in skill over the period of the course, and conceptual improvement as measured by a pre-post test. We study two MOOCs offered on edX.org by MIT faculty: Circuits and Electronics (6.002x) and Mechanics Review (8.MReV). Surprisingly, we find strong negative correlations in 6.002x between student skill and resource use; we attribute these findings to the fact that students with higher initial skills can do the exercises faster and with less time spent on instructional resources. We find weak or slightly negative correlations between relative improvement and resource use in 6.002x. The correlations with learning are stronger for conceptual knowledge in 8.MReV than with relative improvement, but similar for all course activities (except that eText checkpoint questions correlate more strongly with relative improvement). Clearly, the wide distribution of demographics and initial skill in MOOCs challenges us to isolate the habits of learning and resource use that correlate with learning for different students.",,,,,,99,Correlating skill and improvement in 2 MOOCs with a student's time on tasks,Champaign J.; Colvin K.F.; Liu A.; Fredericks C.; Seaton D.; Pritchard D.E.,"Champaign, John (36132751000); Colvin, Kimberly F.

Demographic differences in how students navigate through MOOCs,2014,Full Paper,Student Skills and behavior,"The current generation of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) attract a diverse student audience from all age groups and over 196 countries around the world. Researchers, educators, and the general public have recently become interested in how the learning experience in MOOCs differs from that in traditional courses. A major component of the learning experience is how students navigate through course content. This paper presents an empirical study of how students navigate through MOOCs, and is, to our knowledge, the first to investigate how navigation strategies differ by demographics such as age and country of origin. We performed data analysis on the activities of 140, 546 students in four edX MOOCs and found that certificate earners skip on average 22% of the course content, that they frequently employ non-linear navigation by jumping backward to earlier lecture sequences, and that older students and those from countries with lower student-teacher ratios are more comprehensive and non-linear when navigating through the course. From these findings, we suggest design recommendations such as for MOOC platforms to develop more detailed forms of certification that incentivize students to deeply engage with the content rather than just doing the minimum necessary to earn a passing grade. Finally, to enable other researchers to reproduce and build upon our findings, we have made our data set and analysis scripts publicly available.",,,,,,100,Demographic differences in how students navigate through MOOCs,Guo P.J.; Reinecke K.,"Guo, Philip J.

Understanding in-video dropouts and interaction peaks inonline lecture videos,2014,Full Paper,Course materials,"With thousands of learners watching the same online lecture videos, analyzing video watching patterns provides a unique opportunity to understand how students learn with videos. This paper reports a large-scale analysis of in-video dropout and peaks in viewership and student activity, using second-by-second user interaction data from 862 videos in four Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) on edX. We find higher dropout rates in longer videos, re-watching sessions (vs first-time), and tutorials (vs lectures). Peaks in re-watching sessions and play events indicate points of interest and confusion. Results show that tutorials (vs lectures) and re-watching sessions (vs first-time) lead to more frequent and sharper peaks. In attempting to reason why peaks occur by sampling 80 videos, we observe that 61% of the peaks accompany visual transitions in the video, e.g., a slide view to a classroom view. Based on this observation, we identify five student activity patterns that can explain peaks: starting from the beginning of a new material, returning to missed content, following a tutorial step, replaying a brief segment, and repeating a non-visual explanation. Our analysis has design implications for video authoring, editing, and interface design, providing a richer understanding of video learning on MOOCs.",,,,,,99,Understanding in-video dropouts and interaction peaks in online lecture videos,Kim J.; Guo P.J.; Seaton D.T.; Mitros P.; Gajos K.Z.; Miller R.C.,"Kim, Juho (39361826000); Guo, Philip J.

How video production affects student engagement: an empirical study of MOOC videos,2014,Full Paper,Course materials,"Videos are a widely-used kind of resource for online learning. This paper presents an empirical study of how video production decisions affect student engagement in online educational videos. To our knowledge, ours is the largest-scale study of video engagement to date, using data from 6.9 million video watching sessions across four courses on the edX MOOC platform. We measure engagement by how long students are watching each video, and whether they attempt to answer post-video assessment problems. Our main findings are that shorter videos are much more engaging, that informal talking-head videos are more engaging, that Khan-style tablet drawings are more engaging, that even high-quality pre-recorded classroom lectures might not make for engaging online videos, and that students engage differently with lecture and tutorial videos. Based upon these quantitative findings and qualitative insights from interviews with edX staff, we developed a set of recommendations to help instructors and video producers take better advantage of the online video format.

Hint systems may negatively impact performance in educational games,2014,Full Paper,Course materials,"Video games are increasingly recognized as a compelling platform for instruction that could be leveraged to teach students at scale. Hint systems that provide personalized feedback to students in real time are a central component of many effective interactive learning environments, however little is known about how hints impact player behavior and motivation in educational games. In this work, we study the effectiveness of hints by comparing four designs based on successful hint systems in intelligent tutoring systems and commercial games. We present results from a study of 50, 000 students showing that all four hint systems negatively impacted performance compared to a baseline condition with no hints. These results suggest that traditional hint systems may not translate well into the educational game environment, highlighting the importance of studying student behavior to understand the impact of new interactive learning technologies.

Teaching recommender systems at large scale: evaluation and lessons learned from a hybrid MOOC,2014,Full Paper,The role of the instructor,"In Fall 2013 we offered an open online Introduction to Recommender Systems through Coursera, while simultaneously offering a for-credit version of the course on-campus using the Coursera platform and a flipped classroom instruction model. As the goal of offering this course was to experiment with this type of instruction, we performed extensive evaluation including surveys of demographics, self-assessed skills, and learning intent; we also designed a knowledge-assessment tool specifically for the subject matter in this course, administering it before and after the course to measure learning. We also tracked students through the course, including separating out students enrolled for credit from those enrolled only for the free, open course. This article reports on our findings.

Do professors matter?: using an a/b test to evaluate the impact of instructor involvement on MOOC student outcomes,2014,Full Paper,The role of the instructor,"This research investigates the impact professors, and other instructional staff, have on student content knowledge acquisition in a physical science MOOC offered through the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. An A/B test was used to randomly assign MOOC participants in either a control group (with no instructional interaction) or an intervention group (in which the professor and teaching assistants responded to comments in the discussion and complied summary weekly feedback statements) to identify the differences in learning outcomes, participation rates, and student satisfaction. The study found that instructor intervention had no statistically significant impact on overall completion rates, overall badge acquisition rates, student participation rates, or satisfaction with the course, but did (p<0.05) lead to a higher rate of forum badge completion, an area that was targeted by the intervention.",,,,,,100,Do professors matter?

Monitoring MOOCs: which information sources do instructors value?,2014,Full Paper,The role of the instructor,"For an instructor who is teaching a massive open online course (MOOC), what is the best way to understand their class? What is the best way to view how the students are interacting with the content while the course is running? To help prepare for the next iteration, how should the course's data be best analyzed after the fact? How do these instructional monitoring needs differ between online courses with tens of thousands of students and courses with only tens? This paper reports the results of a survey of 92 MOOC instructors who answered questions about which information they find useful in their course, with the end goal of creating an information display for MOOC instructors. The main findings are: (i) quantitative data sources such as grades, although useful, are not sufficient; understanding the activity in discussion forums and student surveys was rated useful for all use cases by a large majority of respondents, (ii) chat logs were not seen as useful, (iii) for the most part, the same sources of information were seen as useful as found in surveys of smaller online courses, (iv) mockups of existing and novel visualization techniques were responded to positively for use both while the course is running and for planning a revision of the course, and (v) a wide range of views was expressed about other details.",,,,,,100,Monitoring MOOCs: Which information sources do instructors value?,Stephens-Martinez K.; Hearst M.A.; Fox A.,"Stephens-Martinez, Kristin (56144855700); Hearst, Marti A.

Divide and correct: using clusters to grade short answers at scale,2014,Full Paper,Assessment,"In comparison to multiple choice or other recognition-oriented forms of assessment, short answer questions have been shown to offer greater value for both students and teachers; for students they can improve retention of knowledge, while for teachers they provide more insight into student understanding. Unfortunately, the same open-ended nature which makes them so valuable also makes them more difficult to grade at scale. To address this, we propose a cluster-based interface that allows teachers to read, grade, and provide feedback on large groups of answers at once. We evaluated this interface against an unclustered baseline in a within-sub-jects study with 25 teachers, and found that the clustered interface allows teachers to grade substantially faster, to give more feedback to students, and to develop a high-level view of students' understanding and misconceptions.",,,,,,100,Divide and correct: Using clusters to grade short answers at scale,Brooks M.; Basu S.; Jacobs C.; Vanderwende L.,"Brooks, Michael (57194531795); Basu, Sumit (14064542600); Jacobs, Charles (7202179404); Vanderwende, Lucy (56118814700)",57194531795; 14064542600; 7202179404; 56118814700,Divide and correct: Using clusters to grade short answers at scale,2014.0,L@S 2014 - Proceedings of the 1st ACM Conference on Learning at Scale,,,,89,98,9.0,50.0,10.1145/2556325.2566243,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84899668403&doi=10.1145%2f2556325.2566243&partnerID=40&md5=80e610b1da27b0a6c6b13c717fbd4a7d,"University of Washington, Seattle, WA, United States; Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA, United States","Brooks M., University of Washington, Seattle, WA, United States, Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA, United States; Basu S., Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA, United States; Jacobs C., Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA, United States; Vanderwende L., Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA, United States",Assessment; Clustering; Clustering interfaces; Grading; Grading interfaces; MOOCs; User interfaces,Grading; User interfaces; Assessment; Cluster-based; Clustering; Feedback to students; Large groups; MOOCs; Multiple choice; Students,,,,,,,"Anderson R., Biddle W., On asking people questions about what they are reading, Psychology of Learning and Motivation, 9, (1975); Basu S., Jacobs C., Vanderwende L., Powergrading: A clustering approach to amplify human effort for short answer grading, TACL, 1, pp. 391-402, (2013); Bloom B., The 2 sigma problem: The search for methods of group instruction as effective as one-to-one tutoring, Edu.

Scaling short-answer grading by combining peer assessment with algorithmic scoring,2014,Full Paper,Assessment,"Peer assessment helps students reflect and exposes them to different ideas. It scales assessment and allows large online classes to use open-ended assignments. However, it requires students to spend significant time grading. How can we lower this grading burden while maintaining quality? This paper integrates peer and machine grading to preserve the robustness of peer assessment and lower grading burden. In the identify-verify pattern, a grading algorithm first predicts a student grade and estimates confidence, which is used to estimate the number of peer raters required. Peers then identify key features of the answer using a rubric. Finally, other peers verify whether these feature labels were accurately applied. This pattern adjusts the number of peers that evaluate an answer based on algorithmic confidence and peer agreement. We evaluated this pattern with 1370 students in a large, online design class. With only 54% of the student grading time, the identify-verify pattern yields 80-90% of the accuracy obtained by taking the median of three peer scores, and provides more detailed feedback. A second experiment found that verification dramatically improves accuracy with more raters, with a 20% gain over the peer-median with four raters. However, verification also leads to lower initial trust in the grading system. The identify-verify pattern provides an example of how peer work and machine learning can combine to improve the learning experience.",,,,,,100,Scaling short-answer grading by combining peer assessment with algorithmic scoring,Kulkarni C.; Socher R.; Bernstein M.S.; Klemmer S.R.,"Kulkarni, Chinmay (36651262600); Socher, Richard (24766896100); Bernstein, Michael S.

Self-evaluation in advanced power searching and mapping with google MOOCs,2014,Full Paper,Assessment,"While there is a large amount of work on creating autograded massive open online courses (MOOCs), some kinds of complex, qualitative exam questions are still beyond the current state of the art. For MOOCs that need to deal with these kinds of questions, it is not possible for a small course staff to grade students' qualitative work. To test the efficacy of self-evaluation as a method for complex-question evaluation, students in two Google MOOCs have submitted projects and evaluated their own work. For both courses, teaching assistants graded a random sample of papers and compared their grades with self-evaluated student grades. We found that many of the submitted projects were of very high quality, and that a large majority of self-evaluated projects were accurately evaluated, scoring within just a few points of the gold standard grading.",,,,,,100,Self-evaluation in advanced power searching and mapping with google MOOCs,Wilkowski J.; Russell D.M.; Deutsch A.,"Wilkowski, Julia (56145762800); Russell, Daniel M.

Superposter behavior in MOOC forums,2014,Full Paper,Forums and chat rooms,"Discussion forums, employed by MOOC providers as the primary mode of interaction among instructors and students, have emerged as one of the important components of online courses. We empirically study contribution behavior in these online collaborative learning forums using data from 44 MOOCs hosted on Coursera, focusing primarily on the highest-volume contributors- ""superposters""-in a forum. We explore who these superposters are and study their engagement patterns across the MOOC platform, with a focus on the following question-to what extent is superposting a positive phenomenon for the forum? Specifically, while superposters clearly contribute heavily to the forum in terms of quantity, how do these contributions rate in terms of quality, and does this prolific posting behavior negatively impact contribution from the large remainder of students in the class? We analyze these questions across the courses in our dataset, and find that superposters display above-average engagement across Coursera, enrolling in more courses and obtaining better grades than the average forum participant; additionally, students who are superposters in one course are significantly more likely to be superposters in other courses they take. In terms of utility, our analysis indicates that while being neither the fastest nor the most upvoted, superposters' responses are speedier and receive more upvotes than the average forum user's posts; a manual assessment of quality on a subset of this content supports this conclusion that a large fraction of superposter contributions indeed constitute useful content. Finally, we find that superposters' prolific contribution behavior does not 'drown out the silent majority'-high superposter activity correlates positively and significantly with higher overall activity and forum health, as measured by total contribution volume, higher average perceived utility in terms of received votes, and a smaller fraction of orphaned threads.

Chatrooms in MOOCs: all talk and no action,2014,Full Paper,Forums and chat rooms,"We study effects of introducing a real-time chatroom into a massive open online course with several thousand students, supplementing an existing forum. The chatroom was supported by teaching assistants, and generated thousands of lines of discussion by 28% of 681 consenting chat condition participants, mostly on-topic. Despite this, chat activity remained low (μ = 8.2 messages per hour) and we could find no significant effect of chat use on objective or subjective dependent variables such as grades, retention, forum participation, or students' sense of community. Further investigation reveals that only 12% of chat participants have substantive interactions, while the remainder are either passive or have trivial interactions that are unlikely to result in learning. We also find that pervasive, highly visible chat interfaces are highly effective in encouraging both active and substantive participation in chat. When compared to chat interfaces that are restricted to a single webpage, the pervasive interface exhibits 2.8 times as many users with substantive interactions.",,,,,,100,Chatrooms in MOOCs: All talk and no action,Coetzee D.; Fox A.; Hearst M.A.; Hartmann B.,"Coetzee, Derrick (25824921100); Fox, Armando (35571093800); Hearst, Marti A.

Effective Sampling for Large-scale Automated Writing Evaluation Systems,2015,Full Paper,Analysis,"Automated writing evaluation (AWE) has been shown to be an effective mechanism for quickly providing feedback to students. It has already seen wide adoption in enterprise-scale applications and is starting to be adopted in large-scale contexts. Training an AWE model has historically required a single batch of several hundred writing examples and human scores for each of them. This requirement limits large-scale adoption of AWE since human-scoring essays is costly. Here we evaluate algorithms for ensuring that AWE models are consistently trained using the most informative essays. Our results show how to minimize training set sizes while maximizing predictive performance, thereby reducing cost without unduly sacrificing accuracy. We conclude with a discussion of how to integrate this approach into large-scale AWE systems.

Improving Student Modeling Through Partial Credit and Problem Difficulty,2015,Full Paper,Analysis,"task largely driven by binary models that predict student knowledge or next problem correctness (i.e., Knowledge Tracing (KT)). However, using a binary construct for student assessment often causes researchers to overlook the feedback innate to these platforms. The present study considers a novel method of tabling an algorithmically determined partial credit score and problem difficulty bin for each student's current problem to predict both binary and partial next problem correctness. This study was conducted using log files from ASSISTments, an adaptive mathematics tutor, from the 2012-2013 school year. The dataset consisted of 338,297 problem logs linked to 15,253 unique student identification numbers. Findings suggest that an efficiently tabled model considering partial credit and problem difficulty performs about as well as KT on binary predictions of next problem correctness. This method provides the groundwork for modifying KT in an attempt to optimize student modeling.

Addressing Common Analytic Challenges to Randomized Experiments in MOOCs: Attrition and Zero-Inflation,2015,Full Paper,Analysis,"Massive open online course (MOOC) platforms increasingly allow easily implemented randomized experiments. The heterogeneity of MOOC students, however, leads to two methodological obstacles in analyzing interventions to increase engagement. (1) Many MOOC participation metrics have distributions with substantial positive skew from highly active users as well as zero-inflation from high attrition. (2) High attrition means that in some experimental designs, most users assigned to the treatment never receive it; analyses that do not consider attrition result in ""intent-to-treat"" (ITT) estimates that underestimate the true effects of interventions. We address these challenges in analyzing an intervention to improve forum participation in the 2014 JusticeX course offered on the edX MOOC platform. We compare the results of four ITT models (OLS, logistic, quantile, and zero-inflated negative binomial regressions) and three ""treatment-ontreated"" (TOT) models (Wald estimator, 2SLS with a second stage logistic model, and instrumental variables quantile regression). A combination of logistic, quantile, and zero-inflated negative binomial regressions provide the most comprehensive description of the ITT effects. TOT methods then adjust the ITT underestimates. Substantively, we demonstrate that self-assessment questions about forum participation encourage more students to engage in forums and increases the participation of already active students.

However, not every peer learning experience online sees successful adoption. This paper articulates and addresses three adoption challenges for global-scale peer learning. First, peer interactions struggle to bootstrap critical mass. However, class incentives can signal importance and spur initial usage. Second, online classes have limited peer visibility and awareness, so students often feel alone even when surrounded by peers. We find that highlighting interdependence and strengthening norms can mitigate this issue. Third, teachers can readily access ""big"" aggregate data but not ""thick"" contextual data that helps build intuitions, so software should guide teachers' scaffolding of peer interactions. We illustrate these challenges through studying 8,500 students' usage of two peer learning platforms, Talkabout and PeerStudio. This paper measures efficacy through sign-up and participation rates and the structure and duration of student interactions.

The Prediction of Student First Response Using Prerequisite Skills,2015,Full Paper,Behavior 1,"A large amount of research in the field of educational data analytics has focused primarily on student next problem correctness. Although the prediction of such information is useful in assessing current student performance, it is better for teachers and instructors to place attention on student knowledge over a longer period of time. Several researchers have articulated that it is important to predict aspects that are more meaningful, inspiring our work here to utilize the large amounts of student data available to derive more substantial predictions over student knowledge. Our goal in this paper is to utilize prerequisite information to better predict student knowledge quantitatively as a subsequent skill is begun. Learning systems like ASSISTments and Khan Academy already record such prerequisite information, and can therefore be used to construct a method of prediction as described in this paper. Using these inter-skill relationships, our method estimates students' initial knowledge based on performance on each prerequisite skill. We compare our method with the standard Knowledge Tracing (KT) model and majority class in terms of the predictive accuracy of students' first responses on subsequent skills. Our results support our method as a viable means of representing student prerequisite knowledge in a subsequent skill, leading to results that outperform the majority class and that are comparably superior to KT by providing more definitive student knowledge estimates without sacrificing predictive accuracy.

Blended Learning in Indian Colleges with Massively Empowered Classroom,2015,Full Paper,Behavior 1,"Students in the developing world are frequently cited as being among the most important beneficiaries of online education initiatives such as massive open online courses (MOOCs). While some predict that online classrooms will replace physical classrooms, our experience suggests that blending online and in-person instruction is more likely to succeed in developing regions. However, very little research has actually been done on the effects of online education or blended learning in these environments. In this paper we describe a blended learning initiative that combines videos from a large online course with peer-led sessions for undergraduate technical education in India. We performed a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that indicates our intervention was associated with a small but significant improvement in performance on a summative exam. We discuss the results of the RCT and an ethnographic study of the intervention to make recommendations for future, scalable blended learning initiatives for places such as India.

Attrition and Achievement Gaps in Online Learning,2015,Full Paper,Behavior 1,"Attrition in online learning is generally higher than in traditional settings, especially in large-scale online learning environments. A systematic analysis of individual differences in attrition and performance in 20 massive open online courses (N > 67, 000) revealed a geographic achievement gap and a gender achievement gap. Online learners in Africa, Asia, and Latin America scored substantially lower grades and were only half as likely to persist than those in Europe, Oceania, and Northern America. Women also exhibited lower persistence and performance than men. Yet more persistent learners were only marginally more satisfied with their achievement. The primary obstacle for most learners was finding time for the course, which was partly related to low levels of volitional control. Self-ascribed successful learners reported higher levels of goal striving, growth mindset, and feelings of social belonging than unsuccessful ones. Insights into why learners leave online courses inform models of attrition and targeted interventions to support learners achieve their goals.

Towards Detecting Wheel-Spinning: Future Failure in Mastery Learning,2015,Full Paper,Behavior 1,"Wheel-spinning refers to a phenomenon in which a student has spent a considerable amount of time practicing a skill, yet displays little or no progress towards mastery. Wheelspinning has been shown to be a common problem affecting a significant number of students in different tutoring systems and is negatively associated with learning. In this study, we construct a model of wheel-spinning, using generic features easily calculated from most tutoring systems. We show that for two different systems' data, the model generalizes to future students very well and can detect wheel-spinning in an early stage with high accuracy.

PeerStudio: Rapid Peer Feedback Emphasizes Revision and Improves Performance,2015,Full Paper,Behavior 2,"Rapid feedback is a core component of mastery learning, but feedback on open-ended work requires days or weeks in most classes today. This paper introduces PeerStudio, an assessment platform that leverages the large number of students' peers in online classes to enable rapid feedback on in-progress work. Students submit their draft, give rubricbased feedback on two peers' drafts, and then receive peer feedback. Students can integrate the feedback and repeat this process as often as they desire. In MOOC deployments, the median student received feedback in just twenty minutes. Rapid feedback on in-progress work improves course outcomes: in a controlled experiment, students' final grades improved when feedback was delivered quickly, but not if delayed by 24 hours. More than 3,600 students have used PeerStudio in eight classes, both massive and inperson. This research demonstrates how large classes can leverage their scale to encourage mastery through rapid feedback and revision.

Alumni & Tenured Participants in MOOCs: Analysis of Two Years of MOOC Discussion Channel Activity,2015,Full Paper,Behavior 2,"This study investigates chat room data from a massive open online course (MOOC) that has been organized several times since January 2012. What makes the organization unique is that the chat room has always remained the same, allowing past participants to mingle with the new course takers. Participants who have previously attended the course have started to support the novices, voluntarily taking the role of mentors, while at the same time also learning themselves. Two and a half years of chat logs and interviews show that it is possible that a community consisting of previous and current participants emerges naturally. Furthermore, there are plenty of students that unconditionally help others, even when they themselves no longer attend the course. Our observations suggest that communities of practice emerge naturally around the chat rooms of MOOCs.

A Playful Game Changer: Fostering Student Retention in Online Education with Social Gamification,2015,Full Paper,Behavior 2,"Many MOOCs report high drop off rates for their students. Among the factors reportedly contributing to this picture are lack of motivation, feelings of isolation, and lack of interactivity in MOOCs. This paper investigates the potential of gamification with social game elements for increasing retention and learning success. Students in our experiment showed a significant increase of 25% in retention period (videos watched) and 23% higher average scores when the course interface was gamified. Social game elements amplify this effect significantly - students in this condition showed an increase of 50% in retention period and 40% higher average test scores.

The tool integrates data request/authorization and distribution workflows as well as a simple analytics module upload format to enable reuse and replication of analytics results among instructors and researchers. We survey the evolving landscape of competing data models, all of which can be accommodated in the platform. Data model descriptions are provided to analytics authors who choose, much like with smartphone app stores, to write for any number of data models depending on their needs and the proliferation of the particular data model. Two case study examples of analytics and interactive visualizations are described in the paper.

Learning is Not a Spectator Sport: Doing is Better than Watching for Learning from a MOOC,2015,Full Paper,Learning,"The printing press long ago and the computer today have made widespread access to information possible. Learning theorists have suggested, however, that mere information is a poor way to learn. Instead, more effective learning comes through doing. While the most popularized element of today's MOOCs are the video lectures, many MOOCs also include interactive activities that can afford learning by doing. This paper explores the learning benefits of the use of informational assets (e.g., videos and text) in MOOCs, versus the learning by doing opportunities that interactive activities provide. We find that students doing more activities learn more than students watching more videos or reading more pages. We estimate the learning benefit from extra doing (1 SD increase) to be more than six times that of extra watching or reading. Our data, from a psychology MOOC, is correlational in character, however we employ causal inference mechanisms to lend support for the claim that the associations we find are causal.

Exploring the Effect of Confusion in Discussion Forums of Massive Open Online Courses,2015,Full Paper,Learning,"Thousands of students enroll in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) to seek opportunities for learning and selfimprovement. However, the learning process often involves struggles with confusion, which may have an adverse effect on the course participation experience, leading to dropout along the way. In this paper, we quantify that effect. We describe a classification model using discussion forum behavior and clickstream data to automatically identify posts that express confusion. We then apply survival analysis to quantify the impact of confusion on student dropout. The results demonstrate that the more confusion students express or are exposed to, the lower the probability of their retention. Receiving support and resolution of confusion helps mitigate this effect. We explore the differential effects of confusion expressed in different contexts and related to different aspects of courses. We conclude with implications for design of interventions towards improving the retention of students in MOOCs.

Uncovering Trajectories of Informal Learning in Large Online Communities of Creators,2015,Full Paper,Learning,"We analyzed informal learning in Scratch Online - an online community with over 4.3 million users and 6.7 million instances of user-generated content. Users develop projects, which are graphical interfaces consisting of interacting programming blocks. We investigated two fundamental questions of how we can model informal learning, and which patterns of informal learning emerge. We proceeded in two phases. First, we modeled learning as a trajectory of cumulative programming block usage by long-term users who created at least 50 projects. Second, we applied K-means++ clustering to uncover patterns of learning and corresponding subpopulations. We found four groups of users manifesting four different patterns of learning, ranging from the smallest to the largest improvement. At one end of the spectrum, users learned more and in a faster manner. At the opposite end, users did not show much learning progress, even after creating dozens of projects. The modeling and clustering of trajectory patterns that enabled us to quantitatively analyze informal learning may be applicable to other similar communities. The results can also support administrators of online communities in implementing customized interventions for specific subpopulations.

Probabilistic Use Cases: Discovering Behavioral Patterns for Predicting Certification,2015,Full Paper,Learning,"Advances in open-online education have led to a dramatic increase in the size, diversity, and traceability of learner populations, offering tremendous opportunities to study detailed learning behavior of users around the world. This paper adapts the topic modeling approach of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to uncover behavioral structure from student logs in a MITx Massive Open Online Course, 8.02x: Electricity and Magnetism. LDA is typically found in the field of natural language processing, where it identifies the latent topic structure within a collection of documents. However, this framework can be adapted for analysis of user-behavioral patterns by considering user interactions with courseware as a ""bag of interactions"" equivalent to the ""bag of words"" model found in topic modeling. By employing this representation, LDA forms probabilistic use cases that clusters students based on their behavior. Through the probability distributions associated with each use case, this approach provides an interpretable representation of user access patterns, while reducing the dimensionality of the data and improving accuracy. Using only the first week of logs, we can predict whether or not a student will earn a certificate with 0.81-0.01 crossvalidation accuracy. Thus, the method presented in this paper is a powerful tool in understanding user behavior and predicting outcomes.

Bayesian Ordinal Peer Grading,2015,Full Paper,Grading,"Massive Online Open Courses have become an accessible and affordable choice for education. This has led to new technical challenges for instructors such as student evaluation at scale. Recent work has found ordinal peer grading, where individual grader orderings are aggregated into an overall ordering of assignments, to be a viable alternate to traditional instructor/ staff evaluation [23]. Existing techniques, which extend rank-aggregation methods, produce a single ordering as output. While these rankings have been found to be an accurate reflection of assignment quality on average, they do not communicate any of the uncertainty inherent in the assessment process. In particular, they do not to provide instructors with an estimate of the uncertainty of each assignment's position in the ranking. In this work, we tackle this problem by applying Bayesian techniques to the ordinal peer grading problem, using MCMC-based sampling techniques in conjunction with the Mallows model. Experiments are performed on realworld peer grading datasets, which demonstrate that the proposed method provides accurate uncertainty information via the estimated posterior distributions.

An Automated Grading/Feedback System for 3-View Engineering Drawings using RANSAC,2015,Full Paper,Grading,"We propose a novel automated grading system that can compare two multiview engineering drawings consisting of three views that may have allowable translations, scales, and offsets, and can recognize frequent error types as well as individual drawing errors. We show that translation, scale, and offset-invariant comparison can be conducted by estimating the affine transformation for each individual view within drawings. Our system directly aims to evaluate students' skills creating multiview engineering drawings. Since it is important for our students to be familiar with widely used software such as AutoCAD, our system does not require a separate interface or environment, but directly grades the saved DWG/DXF files from AutoCAD. We show the efficacy of the proposed algorithm by comparing its results with human grading. Beyond the advantages of convenience and accuracy, based on our data set of students' answers, we can analyze the common errors of the class as a whole using our system.

Mathematical Language Processing: Automatic Grading and Feedback for Open Response Mathematical Questions,2015,Full Paper,Grading,"While computer and communication technologies have provided effective means to scale up many aspects of education, the submission and grading of assessments such as homework assignments and tests remains a weak link. In this paper, we study the problem of automatically grading the kinds of open response mathematical questions that figure prominently in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) courses. Our data-driven framework for mathematical language processing (MLP) leverages solution data from a large number of learners to evaluate the correctness of their solutions, assign partial-credit scores, and provide feedback to each learner on the likely locations of any errors. MLP takes inspiration from the success of natural language processing for text data and comprises three main steps. First, we convert each solution to an open response mathematical question into a series of numerical features. Second, we cluster the features from several solutions to uncover the structures of correct, partially correct, and incorrect solutions. We develop two different clustering approaches, one that leverages generic clustering algorithms and one based on Bayesian nonparametrics. Third, we automatically grade the remaining (potentially large number of) solutions based on their assigned cluster and one instructor-provided grade per cluster. As a bonus, we can track the cluster assignment of each step of a multistep solution and determine when it departs from a cluster of correct solutions, which enables us to indicate the likely locations of errors to learners. We test and validate MLP on real-world MOOC data to demonstrate how it can substantially reduce the human effort required in large-scale educational platforms.

BayesRank: A Bayesian Approach to Ranked Peer Grading,2015,Full Paper,Grading,"Advances in online and computer supported education afford exciting opportunities to revolutionize the classroom, while also presenting a number of new challenges not faced in traditional educational settings. Foremost among these challenges is the problem of accurately and efficiently evaluating learner work as the class size grows, which is directly related to the larger goal of providing quality, timely, and actionable formative feedback. Recently there has been a surge in interest in using peer grading methods coupled with machine learning to accurately and fairly evaluate learner work while alleviating the instructor bottleneck and grading overload. Prior work in peer grading almost exclusively focuses on numerically scored grades - either real-valued or ordinal. In this work, we consider the implications of peer ranking in which learners rank a small subset of peer work from strongest to weakest, and propose new types of computational analyses that can be applied to this ranking data. We adopt a Bayesian approach to the ranked peer grading problem and develop a novel model and method for utilizing ranked peer-grading data. We additionally develop a novel procedure for adaptively identifying which work should be ranked by particular peers in order to dynamically resolve ambiguity in the data and rapidly resolve a clearer picture of learner performance. We showcase our results on both synthetic and several real-world educational datasets.

Staggered Versus All-At-Once Content Release in Massive Open Online Courses: Evaluating a Natural Experiment,2015,Full Paper,Design,"We report on an experiment testing the effects of releasing all of the content in a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) at launch versus in a staggered release. In 2013, HarvardX offered two ""runs"" of the HeroesX course: In the first, content was released weekly over four months; in the second, all content was released at once. We develop three operationalizations of ""ontrackness"" to measure how students participated in sync with the recommended syllabus. Ontrackness in both versions was low, though in the second, mean ontrackness was approximately one-half of levels in the first HeroesX. We find few differences in persistence, participation, and completion between the two runs. Controlling for a students' number of active weeks, we estimate modest positive effects of ontrackness on certification. The revealed preferences of students for flexibility and the minimal benefits of ontrackness suggest that releasing content all at once may be a viable strategy for MOOC designers.

Autonomously Generating Hints by Inferring Problem Solving Policies,2015,Full Paper,Design,"Exploring the whole sequence of steps a student takes to produce work, and the patterns that emerge from thousands of such sequences is fertile ground for a richer understanding of learning. In this paper we autonomously generate hints for the Code.org 'Hour of Code,' (which is to the best of our knowledge the largest online course to date) using historical student data. We first develop a family of algorithms that can predict the way an expert teacher would encourage a student to make forward progress. Such predictions can form the basis for effective hint generation systems. The algorithms are more accurate than current state-of-the-art methods at recreating expert suggestions, are easy to implement and scale well. We then show that the same framework which motivated the hint generating algorithms suggests a sequence-based statistic that can be measured for each learner. We discover that this statistic is highly predictive of a student's future success.

Problems Before Solutions: Automated Problem Clarification at Scale,2015,Full Paper,Design,"Automatic assessment reduces the need for individual feedback in massive courses, but often focuses only on scoring solutions, rather than assessing whether students correctly understand problems. We present an enriched approach to automatic assessment that explicitly assists students in understanding the detailed specification of technical problems that they are asked to solve, in addition to evaluating their solutions. Students are given a suite of solution test cases, but they must first unlock each test case by validating its behavior before they are allowed to apply it to their proposed solution. When provided with this automated feedback early in the problem-solving process, students ask fewer clarificatory questions and express less confusion about assessments. As a result, instructors spend less time explaining problems to students. In a 1300-person university course, we observed that the vast majority of students chose to validate their understanding of test cases before attempting to solve problems. These students reported that the validation process improved their understanding.

An E-Report Scoring Method based on Student Peer Evaluation using Groupware,2015,WIP,,"Nowadays, many universities utilize groupware support for students to post and share their e-reports, and the students can browse and vote other students' reports in e-learning. Teachers then need to evaluate all students' reports, but this will require a great deal of time and effort for a fair evaluation of the reports. Therefore, we propose an e-report scoring method based on student peer evaluation by considering the relationship between voting and posting time of the e-reports, to promote the quality of the votes and prevent unfair votes. Then, the method can provide scores of reports based on a voting graph by analyzing students who vote the reports. In this paper, we perform a student peer evaluation using groupware based on voting with a ""Like"" button in a course practice, and compare the results with teachers' evaluation.

Analysis of a Large-Scale Formative Writing Assessment System with Automated Feedback,2015,WIP,,"Formative writing systems with automated scoring provide opportunities for students to write, receive feedback, and then revise essays in a timely iterative cycle. This paper describes ongoing investigations of a formative writing tool through mining student data in order to understand how the system performs and to measure improvement in student writing. The sampled data included over 1.3M student essays written in response to approximately 200 pre-defined prompts as well as a log of all student actions and computer generated feedback. Analyses both measured and modeled changes in student performance over revisions, the effects of system responses and the amount of time students spent working on assignments. Implications are discussed for employing large-scale data analytics to improve educational outcomes, to understand the role of feedback in writing, to drive improvements in formative technology and to aid in designing better kinds of feedback and scaffolding to support students in the writing process.

Are You Listening?: Social Roles and Perceived Value of Statements in Online Learning Communities,2015,WIP,,"An important part of learning is interactions with peers, mentors, teaching assistants and the instructor. Discussions and group work allow for interactive learning and deeper understanding of class concepts. Online learning environments struggle to replicate this process. This is especially true when the scale of an online class is increased. In order to address this issue a few MOOCs solicit teaching assistants to answer questions, and through their social position, help set academic standards in discussion forums. However, little is know about how different social roles influence the attribution of value to statements in these environments. This study demonstrates that the attitudes expressed by individuals in facilitating roles influence the acceptance of information shared in a discussion board setting.

Clustering Student Programming Assignments to Multiply Instructor Leverage,2015,WIP,,"A challenge in introductory and intermediate programming courses is understanding how students approached solving a particular programming problem, in order to provide feedback on how they might improve. In both Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and large residential courses, such feedback is dificult to provide for each student individually. To multiply the instructor's leverage, we would like to group student submissions according to the general problem-solving strategy they used, as the first stage of a ""feedback pipeline"". We describe ongoing explorations of a variety of clustering algorithms and similarity metrics using a corpus of over 800 student submissions to a simple programming assignment from a programming MOOC. We find that for a majority of submissions, it is possible to automatically create clusters such that an instructor ""eyeballing"" some representative submissions from each cluster can readily describe qualitatively what the common elements are in student submissions in that cluster. This information can be the basis for feedback to the students or for comparing one group of students' approach with another's.

Clustering-Based Active Learning for CPSGrader,2015,WIP,,"In this work, we propose and evaluate an active learning algorithm in context of CPSGrader, an automatic grading and feedback generation tool for laboratory-based courses in the area of cyber-physical systems. CPSGrader detects the presence of certain classes of mistakes using test benches that are generated in part via machine learning from solutions that have the fault and those that do not (positive and negative examples). We develop a clustering-based active learning technique that selects from a large database of unlabeled solutions, a small number of reference solutions for the expert to label that will be used as training data. The goal is to achieve better accuracy of fault identification with fewer reference solutions as compared to random selection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm using data obtained from an on-campus laboratory-based course at UC Berkeley.

Connecting the Dots: Predicting Student Grade Sequences from Bursty MOOC Interactions over Time,2015,WIP,,"In this work, we track the interaction of students across multiple Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) on edX. Leveraging the ""burstiness"" factor of three of the most commonly exhibited interaction forms made possible by online learning (i.e, video lecture viewing, coursework access and discussion forum posting), we take on the task of predicting student performance (operationalized as grade) across these courses. Specifically, we utilize the probabilistic framework of Conditional Random Fields (CRF) to formalize the problem of predicting the sequence of grades achieved by a student in different MOOCs, taking into account the contextual dependency of this outcome measure on students' general interaction trend across courses. Based on a comparative analysis of the combination of interaction features, our best CRF model can achieve a precision of 0.581, recall of 0.660 and a weighted F-score of 0.560, outweighing several baseline discriminative classifiers applied at each sequence position. These findings have implications for initiating early instructor intervention, so as to engage students along less active interaction dimensions that could be associated with low grades.

Cultural Relevance in MOOCs: Asking About Socioeconomic Context,2015,WIP,,"Existing datasets tell us only a partial story about the contextual factors that impact learners in Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs). Information about race/ethnicity, education, and income helps us understand socioeconomic status, but such data is notoriously difficult to collect in an international context. Extant MOOC studies have not paid due attention to socioeconomic variables; they have either taken a U.S.-centric approach, ignored important country-specific dimensions of variables, or failed to ask about certain variables altogether, such as race/ethnicity. During a qualitative study of 24 selfregulated learners from population groups underrepresented in MOOCs, we piloted a short U.S.- centric demographic questionnaire. Preliminary results suggest that a large-scale survey designed for both cross-national and country-specific analyses would provide valuable information to MOOC researchers.

Demographic Differences in a Growth Mindset Incentive Structure for Educational Games,2015,WIP,,"Video games have great potential to motivate students in environments for learning at scale. However, little is known about how to design in-game incentive structures to maximize learning and engagement. In this work, we expand on our previous research that introduced a new ""brain points"" incentive structure designed to promote the growth mindset, or the belief that intelligence is malleable. We replicate our original findings, showing that brain points increase student persistence and use of strategy. We also explore how brain points impact students from different demographic groups. We find that brain points are less engaging for low-income students, and discuss methods of improving our design in the future.

Designing MOOCs as Interactive Places for Collaborative Learning,2015,WIP,,"The Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) paradigm has developed rapidly and achieved significant attention from a broad range of populations. However, many people who enroll in MOOCs do not have successful learning experiences. For example, some studies suggest that the relatively weak feelings of community and meager opportunities for collaboration may be contributing to a high dropout rate in MOOCs. In light of such problems, we are exploring new design features that could support enhanced social interactions, collaborative learning and feelings of community. We present our design ideas through a set of activity design scenarios, along with an analysis of possible benefits and negative consequences of our design.

Do Numeric Ratings Impact Peer Reviewers?  359-362,2015,WIP,,"Research suggests that online peer review can provide critical help to learners who would otherwise not be given individualized feedback on their work. However, little is known about how different characteristics of review systems impact reviewers. This extended abstract presents preliminary results from an online experiment examining how explicit numeric ratings change peer reviews. A between-subject experiment found that peer reviewers who were asked to generate a numeric rating as well as general feedback gave significantly more explanations and made more positive comments compared with reviewers who were asked to give general feedback only. These exploratory findings suggest the need to further examine how online peer review systems' affordances can impact the reviews given in these systems.

Does Online Q&A Activity Vary Based on Topic: A Comparison of Technical and Non-technical Stack Exchange Forums,2015,WIP,,"With the increasing demand on knowledge sharing and problem solving, there is a growing participation on online Question & Answer (Q&A) forums in the recent past. We classify the online community participation on Stack Exchange into two different genres, one is technical and another is non-technical. Though several studies have measured community activity, studies that compare activity across forums within different topic areas are limited. In this work we examine the effect of incentives on contributions by exploring the differences between technical and non-technical communities in terms of user's participation. Given the increased attention on discussion forums as part of online learning, especially MOOCs, we believe that our findings can assist with providing better support for learners across different content areas.

Game Theory based Peer Grading Mechanisms for MOOCs,2015,WIP,,"An efficient peer grading mechanism is proposed for grading the multitude of assignments in online courses. This novel approach is based on game theory and mechanism design. A set of assumptions and a mathematical model is ratified to simulate the dominant strategy behavior of students in a given mechanism. A benchmark function accounting for grade accuracy and workload is established to quantitatively compare effectiveness and scalability of various mechanisms. After multiple iterations of mechanisms under increasingly realistic assumptions, three are proposed: Calibration, Improved Calibration, and Deduction. The Calibration mechanism performs as predicted by game theory when tested in an online crowd-sourced experiment, but fails when students are assumed to communicate. The Improved Calibration mechanism addresses this assumption, but at the cost of more effort spent grading.

Item Ordering Effects with Qualitative Explanations using Online Adaptive Tutoring Data,2015,WIP,,"Online computer adaptive learning is increasingly being used in classrooms as a way to provide guided learning for students. Such tutors have the potential to provide tailored feedback based on specific student needs and misunderstandings. Bayesian knowledge tracing (BKT) is used to model student knowledge when knowledge is assumed to be changing throughout a single assessment period; in contrast, traditional Item Response Theory (IRT) models assume student knowledge to be constant within an assessment period. The basic BKT model assumes that the chance a student transitions from ""not knowing"" to ""knowing"" after each item is the same, and problems are considered learning opportunities. It could be the case, however, that learning is actually context sensitive, where students' learning might be improved when the items and their associated tutoring content are delivered to the student in a particular order. In this paper, we use BKT models to find such context sensitive transition probabilities from real data delivered by an online tutoring system, ASSISTments. After empirically deriving orderings that lead to better learning, we qualitatively analyze the items and their tutoring content to uncover any mechanisms that might explain why such orderings are modeled to have higher learning potential.

Learnersourcing of Complex Assessments,2015,WIP,,"We present results from a pilot study where students successfully created complex assessments for a MOOC in introductory electronics { an area with a very large expert-novice gap. Previous work in learnersourcing found that learners can productively contribute through simple tasks. However, many course resources require a high level of expertise to create, and prior work fell short on tasks with a large expert-novice gap, such as textbook creation or concept tagging. Since these constitute a substantial portion of course creation costs, addressing this issue is prerequisite to substantially shifting MOOC economics through learnersourcing. This represents one of the first successes in learnersourcing with a large expert-novice gap. In the pilot, we reached out to 206 students (out of thousands who met eligibility criteria) who contributed 14 complex high-quality design problems. This results suggests a full cohort could contribute hundreds of problems. We achieved this through a four-pronged approach: (1) pre-selecting top learners (2) community feedback process (3) student mini-course in pedagogy (4) instructor review and involvement.

Learning Experiments Using AB Testing at Scale,2015,WIP,,"We report the one of the first applications of treatment/control group learning experiments in MOOCs. We have compared the efficacy of deliberate practice-practicing a key procedure repetitively-with traditional practice on ""whole problems"". Evaluating the learning using traditional whole problems we find that traditional practice outperforms drag and drop, which in turn outperforms multiple choice. In addition, we measured the amount of learning that occurs during a pretest administered in a MOOC environment that transfers to the same question if placed on the posttest. We place a limit on the amount of such transfer, which suggests that this type of learning effect is very weak compared to the learning observed throughout the entire course.

M-CAFE: Managing MOOC Student Feedback with Collaborative Filtering,2015,WIP,,"Ongoing student feedback on course content and assignments can be valuable for MOOC instructors in the absence of face-to-face-interaction. To collect ongoing feedback and scalably identify valuable suggestions, we built the MOOC Collaborative Assessment and Feedback Engine (M-CAFE). This mobile platform allows MOOC students to numerically assess the course, their own performance, and provide textual suggestions about how the course could be improved on a weekly basis. M-CAFE allows students to visualize how they compare with their peers and read and evaluate what others have suggested, providing peer-to-peer collaborative filtering.

The proposed experiment will compare three content sources - a local lecturer (teacher from an Indian engineering college), a local peer (both male and female students similar to the targeted audience), and an internationally recognized expert (a Stanford lecturer). Students will watch videos by the various source authors, after which we will measure differences in their preference, engagement, and learning.

Supporting Face-to-Face Like Communication Modalities for Asynchronous Assignment Feedback in Math Education,2015,WIP,,"The digitization of educational course content has proved to be problematic for math instructors due to the lack of quality feedback tools that can accommodate the commenter to efficiently express math formulae and convey descriptions about complex ideas contextualized in situ. This paper proposes that RichReview, a document annotation system which creates inking, voice and deictic gestures on top of the student's submitted work, is a possible formative math feedback solution, because it enables face-to-face like commentary within the contexts of the document at hand. A preliminary qualitative evaluation study conducted while having students receive RichReview feedback showed promise to our approach to enhance the quality of feedback, with the implication that incorporating multi-modal feedback into workflows can be an effective method to address elements of feedback submissions lacking in coursework that has moved online.

Supporting Instructors in Collaborating with Researchers using MOOClets,2015,WIP,,"Most education and workplace learning takes place in classroom contexts far removed from laboratories or field sites with special arrangements for scientific research. But digital online resources provide a novel opportunity for large-scale efforts to bridge the realworld and laboratory settings which support data collection and randomized A/B experiments comparing different versions of content or interactions [2]. However, there are substantial technological and practical barriers in aligning instructors and researchers to use learning technologies like blended lessons/exercises & MOOCs as both a service for students and a realistic context to conduct research. This paper explains how the concept of a ""MOOClet"" can facilitate research-practitioner collaborations. MOOClets [3] are defined as modular components of a digital resource that can be implemented in technology to: (1) allow modification to create multiple versions, (2) allow experimental comparison and personalization of different versions, (3) reliably specify what data are collected. We suggest a framework in which instructors specify what kinds of changes to lessons, exercises, and emails they would be willing to adopt, and what data they will collect and make available. Researchers can then: (1) specify or design experiments that compare the effects of different versions on quantifiable outcomes. (2) Explore algorithms for maximizing particular outcomes by choosing alternative versions of a MOOClet based on the input variables available. We present a prototype survey tool for instructors intended to facilitate practitioner-researcher matches and successful collaborations.

The Visible and Invisible in a MOOC Discussion Forum,2015,WIP,,"Online discussion forums in a MOOC setting allow students to become aware of other students enrolled in the course. However, what is (usually) visible in the forums is the output of ""active"" students who engage in asking and answering questions. In addition to such active participants, there is (as always in online communities) a large group of ""passive"" users (so-called lurkers), who might find the forum useful to their learning, and read it regularly, despite remaining ""invisible"". Our analysis of a large MOOC online forum shows that for every active participant in the forum there are two passive ones. 30% of active participants complete the course, compared to only 6.6% of the passive participants. Vice-versa, 67% of students who complete the course are also active in the forum. However, ""invisible activity"" (e.g. reading or searching the forum) is something that both groups practice equally and more frequently, while only 3.3% of forum actions are visible.

Toward the Evaluation of Educational Videos using Bayesian Knowledge Tracing and Big Data,2015,WIP,,"Along with the advent of MOOCs and other online learning platforms such as Khan Academy, the role of online education has continued to grow in relation to that of traditional on-campus instruction. Rather than tackle the problem of evaluating large educational units such as entire online courses, this paper approaches a smaller problem: exploring a framework for evaluating more granular educational units, in this case, short educational videos. We have chosen to leverage an adaptation of traditional Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT), intended to incorporate the usage of video content in addition to assessment activity. By exploring the change in predictive error when alternately including or omitting video activity, we suggest a metric for determining the relevance of videos to associated assessments. To validate our hypothesis and demonstrate the application of our proposed methods we use data obtained from the popular Khan Academy website.

Understanding Learners' General Perception Towards Learning with MOOC Classmates: An Exploratory Study,2015,WIP,,"In this work-in-progress, we present our preliminary findings from an exploratory study on understanding learners' general behavior and perception towards learning with classmates in MOOCs. One-on-one semistructured interview designed with grounded theory method was conducted with seven MOOC learners.

Automatic Interpretable Personalized Learning,2022,Full Paper,Recommendation and Personalization @ Scale,"Personalized learning stems from the idea that students benefit from instructional material tailored to their needs. Many online learning platforms purport to implement some form of personalized learning, often through on-demand tutoring or self-paced instruction, but to our knowledge none have a way to automatically explore for specific opportunities to personalize students' education nor a transparent way to identify the effects of personalization on specific groups of students. In this work we present the Automatic Personalized Learning Service (APLS). The APLS uses multi-armed bandit algorithms to recommend the most effective support to each student that requests assistance when completing their online work, and is currently used by ASSISTments, an online learning platform. The first empirical study of the APLS found that Beta-Bernoulli Thompson Sampling, a popular and effective multi-armed bandit algorithm, was only slightly more capable of selecting helpful support than randomly selecting from the relevant support options. Therefore, we also present Decision Tree Thompson Sampling (DTTS), a novel contextual multi-armed bandit algorithm that integrates the transparency and interpretability of decision trees into Thomson sampling. In simulation, DTTS overcame the challenges of recommending support within an online learning platform and was able to increase students' learning by as much as 10% more than the current algorithm used by the APLS. We demonstrate that DTTS is able to identify qualitative interactions that not only help determine the most effective support for students, but that also generalize well to new students, problems, and support content. The APLS using DTTS is now being deployed at scale within ASSISTments and is a promising tool for all educational learning platforms. © 2022 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,Automatic Interpretable Personalized Learning,Prihar E.; Haim A.; Sales A.; Heffernan N.,"Prihar, Ethan (57211969221); Haim, Aaron (57747961800); Sales, Adam (57193199650); Heffernan, Neil (14041775100)",57211969221; 57747961800; 57193199650; 14041775100,Automatic Interpretable Personalized Learning,2022.0,L@S 2022 - Proceedings of the 9th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,1,11,10.0,5.0,10.1145/3491140.3528267,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132183266&doi=10.1145%2f3491140.3528267&partnerID=40&md5=a3ef922d9e01891839e392f151f1264a,"Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA, United States","Prihar E., Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA, United States; Haim A., Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA, United States; Sales A., Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA, United States; Heffernan N., Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA, United States",contextual bandits; intelligent tutoring systems; multi-armed bandits; personalized learning,Computer aided instruction; E-learning; Education computing; Learning systems; Simulation platform; Students; Contextual banditti; Intelligent tutoring; Intelligent tutoring system; Learning platform; Learning services; Multiarmed bandits (MABs); Online learning; Personalized learning; Thompson samplings; Tutoring system; Decision trees,,,,,,,"Agrawal S., Goyal N., Thompson sampling for contextual bandits with linear payoffs, International Conference on Machine Learning.

Heterogeneity of Treatment Effects of a Video Recommendation System for Algebra,2022,Full Paper,Recommendation and Personalization @ Scale,"Previous research has shown that providing video recommendations to students in virtual learning environments implemented at scale positively affects student achievement. However, it is also critical to evaluate whether the treatment effects are heterogeneous, and whether they depend on contextual variables such as disadvantaged student status and characteristics of the school settings. The current study extends the evaluation of a novel video recommendation system by performing an exploratory search for sources of heterogeneity of treatment effects. This study's design is a multi-site randomized controlled trial with an assignment at the student level across three large and diverse school districts in the southeast United States. The study occurred in Spring 2021, when some students were in regular classrooms and others in online classrooms. The results of the current study replicate positive effects found in a previous field experiment that occurred in Spring 2020, at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Then, causal forests were used to investigate the heterogeneity of treatment effects. This study contributes to the literature on content sequencing systems and recommendation systems by showing how these systems can disproportionally benefit the groups of students who had higher levels of previous algebra ability, followed more recommendations, learned remotely, were Hispanic, and received free or reduced-price lunch, which has implications for the fairness of implementation of educational technology solutions. © 2022 ACM.",,,,,,100,Heterogeneity of Treatment Effects of a Video Recommendation System for Algebra,Leite W.L.; Kuang H.; Shen Z.; Chakraborty N.; Michailidis G.; D'Mello S.; Xing W.,"Leite, Walter L.

Post Recommendation System Impact on Student Participation and Performance in an Online AI Graduate Course,2022,Full Paper,Recommendation and Personalization @ Scale,"Embedding a post recommendation system in online course forums improves students' ability to find relevant course content. Yet, there is limited research quantifying how these interventions impact forum interactions and students' class performance. We randomly divide an on-line class in a Masters degree-seeking program into control and experimental sections. Midway through the class, for the experimental section, we introduce an information retrieval system that suggests relevant posts to students while they compose their new posts. The average number of initial posts in the discussion forum dropped by 55% for the experimental group compared to 21% in the control group. In post-hoc analysis, we classify students as having an active or passive (i.e., mostly lurking) forum participation style. Posts per student per assignment by passive participants in the experimental group decreased by 15%, while passive participants' posts in the control group increased by 200%. The number of answers given by instructors in the experimental group decreased twice as much as the control group after intervention, though the difference was not statistically significant. The reduction of posts was not associated with a decrease in academic performance (grades) for the experimental group. This line of research convinced the popular forum Piazza to implement a post recommendation system similar to that used in these experiments. © 2022 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,Post Recommendation System Impact on Student Participation and Performance in an Online AI Graduate Course,Irish I.;

"A Scenario-based Exploration of Expected Usefulness, Privacy Concerns, and Adoption Likelihood of Learning Analytics",2022,Full Paper,Analytics @ Scale,"Learning analytics has become a robust research area in the last decade, as innovative analytic models of learning data have been created with the goal of enhancing teaching and learning. However, barriers to large scale adoption of such technologies in higher education still exist. In recent years, a strand of research has begun to investigate stakeholders' expectations of learning analytics, hoping to find ways to integrate the innovations into everyday teaching practices. For instance, studies have investigated instructors' ideas about how learning analytics might be helpful, as well as concerns about student data privacy. However, most studies have taken a general approach rather than considering instructors' day-to-day experiences. Using survey methods, we presented instructors with hypothetical scenarios of learning analytics in use across disciplines, class sizes, teaching activities, and types of student data. We asked for ratings of both usefulness and privacy concerns for each proposed teaching situation. Our respondents considered scenarios involving learning outcomes-related data (e.g. grades) to be more useful than those that involve student interactions (e.g. language, social activity). In contrast, privacy concerns were lower for outcomes-oriented scenarios than interactions-focused scenarios. An interesting new finding was a negative correlation of usefulness and privacy; we discuss this in the context of instructors' possible cost-benefit reasoning. We reflect on our findings with respect to future efforts in developing and fielding learning analytics tools. © 2022 ACM.",,,,,,100,"A Scenario-based Exploration of Expected Usefulness, Privacy Concerns, and Adoption Likelihood of Learning Analytics",Li X.V.; Rosson M.B.; Robert J.,"Li, Xiaotian Vivian (57748294000); Rosson, Mary Beth (7003266859); Robert, Jenay (58446967400)",57748294000; 7003266859; 58446967400,"A Scenario-based Exploration of Expected Usefulness, Privacy Concerns, and Adoption Likelihood of Learning Analytics",2022.0,L@S 2022 - Proceedings of the 9th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,48,59,11.0,1.0,10.1145/3491140.3528271,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132174586&doi=10.1145%2f3491140.3528271&partnerID=40&md5=54d1790eb6db9727e1e5da2139e1c452,"The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, United States; Educause, Washington, DC, United States","Li X.V., The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, United States; Rosson M.B., The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, United States; Robert J., Educause, Washington, DC, United States",adoption; design; higher education; instructors; learning analytics; privacy; scenarios; survey,Cost benefit analysis; Data privacy; Education computing; Learning systems; Students; Adoption; Analytic modeling; High educations; Instructor; Learning analytic; Privacy; Privacy concerns; Research areas; Scenario; Scenario-based; Surveys,,,,,,,"Prieto Alvarez C., Martinez-Maldonado R., Buckingham Shum S., LA-DECK: A card-based learning analytics co-design tool, Proceedings of the tenth international conference on learning analytics & knowledge, pp. 63-72, (2020); Arnold K.E., Sclater N., Student perceptions of their privacy in leaning analytics applications, Proceedings of the seventh international learning analytics & knowledge conference, pp. 66-69, (2017); Brown M., Seeing students at scale: How faculty in large lecture courses act upon learning analytics dashboard data, Teaching in Higher Education, 25, 4, pp. 384-400, (2020); Carrol J.M., Five reasons for scenario-based design, Proceedings of the 32nd Annual Hawaii International Conference on Systems Sciences. 1999.

"Incorporating Training, Self-monitoring and AI-Assistance to Improve Peer Feedback Quality",2022,Full Paper,Analytics @ Scale,"Peer review has been recognised as a beneficial approach that promotes higher-order learning and provides students with fast and detailed feedback on their work. Still, there are some common concerns and criticisms associated with the use of peer review that limits its adoption. One of the main points of concern is that feedback provided by students may be ineffective and of low quality. Previous works supply three explanations for why students may fail to provide effective feedback: They lack (1) the ability to provide high-quality feedback, (2) the agency to monitor their work or (3) the incentive to invest the required time and effort as they think the quality of the reviews are not reviewed. To help mitigate these shortcomings, this paper presents a complementary peer review approach that integrates training, self-monitoring and AI quality-control assistance to improve peer feedback quality. In particular, informed by higher education research, we built a set of training materials and a self-monitoring checklist for students to consider while writing their reviews. Also, informed by work from natural language processing, we developed quality control functions that automatically assess feedback submitted and prompt students to improve, if necessary. A between-subjects field experiment with 374 participants was conducted to investigate the approach's efficacy. Findings suggest that offering training, self-monitoring, and quality control functionalities to students assigned to the complementary peer review approach resulted in longer feedback that was perceived as more helpful than those who utilised the regular peer review interface. However, this complementary approach does not seem to affect students judgement (leniency or harshness) or confidence in grading. Directions are suggested to further evaluate and refine peer review systems. © 2022 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,"Incorporating Training, Self-monitoring and AI-Assistance to Improve Peer Feedback Quality",Darvishi A.; Khosravi H.; Abdi S.; Sadiq S.; Gašević D.,"Darvishi, Ali (57219052527); Khosravi, Hassan (27368031300); Abdi, Solmaz (57215930238); Sadiq, Shazia (7006420326); Gašević, Dragan (8549413500)",57219052527; 27368031300; 57215930238; 7006420326; 8549413500,"Incorporating Training, Self-monitoring and AI-Assistance to Improve Peer Feedback Quality",2022.0,L@S 2022 - Proceedings of the 9th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,35,47,12.0,8.0,10.1145/3491140.3528265,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130624218&doi=10.1145%2f3491140.3528265&partnerID=40&md5=973261011555394fb9182ed693c8cd6b,"The University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia; Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia","Darvishi A., The University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia; Khosravi H., The University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia; Abdi S., The University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia; Sadiq S., The University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia; Gašević D., Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia",crowdsourcing in education; feedback literacy; learnersourcing; peer feedback; peer review,Crowdsourcing; Feedback; Grading; Natural language processing systems; Quality assurance; Quality control; Crowdsourcing in education; Detailed feedbacks; Feedback literacy; High quality; Higher-order learning; Learnersourcing; Low qualities; Peer feedback; Peer review; Self-monitoring; Students,,,,,"Australian Research Council’s Industrial Transformation Training Centre for Information Resilience; Australian Government; Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, CIRES, (IC200100022)",This research was supported partially by the Australian Government through the Australian Research Council’s Industrial Transformation Training Centre for Information Resilience (CIRES) project number IC200100022.,"Abdi S., Khosravi H., Sadiq S., Modelling learners in crowdsourcing educational systems, International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education, pp. 3-9, (2020); Abdi S., Khosravi H., Sadiq S., Darvishi A., Open Learner Models for Multi-Activity Educational Systems, International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education, pp. 11-17, (2021); Abdi S., Khosravi H., Sadiq S., Demartini G., Evaluating the Quality of Learning Resources: A Learnersourcing Approach, IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies, 14, 1, pp. 81-92, (2021); Aleven V., McLaughlin E.A., Amos Glenn R., Koedinger K.R., Instruction based on adaptive learning technologies, Handbook of research on learning and instruction, pp. 522-560, (2016); Austin P.C., An introduction to propensity score methods for reducing the effects of confounding in observational studies, Multivariate behavioral research, 46, 3, pp. 399-424, (2011); Baars M., Wijnia L., De Bruin A., Paas F., The relation between student's effort and monitoring judgments during learning: A metaanalysis, Educational Psychology Review, pp. 1-24, (2020); Bates S.P., Galloway R.K., Riise J., Homer D., Assessing the quality of a student-generated question repository, Physical Review Special Topics-Physics Education Research, 10, 2, (2014); Boud D., Cohen R., Sampson J., Peer learning in higher education: Learning from and with each other, Routledge, (2014); Bull S., There Are Open Learner Models About!, IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies, (2020); Cambre J., Klemmer S., Kulkarni C., Juxtapeer: Comparative peer review yields higher quality feedback and promotes deeper reflection, Proceedings of the 2018 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 1-13, (2018); Carless D., Trust, distrust and their impact on assessment reform, Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education, 34, 1, pp. 79-89, (2009); Carless D., From teacher transmission of information to student feedback literacy: Activating the learner role in feedback processes, Active Learning in Higher Education, (2020); Carless D., Kam Ho Chan K., To J., Lo M., Barrett E., Developing students' capacities for evaluative judgement through analysing exemplars, Developing evaluative judgement in Higher Education.

RLens: A Computer-aided Visualization System for Supporting Reflection on Language Learning under Distributed Tutorship,2022,Full Paper,Analytics @ Scale,"With the rise of the gig economy, online language tutoring platforms are becoming increasingly popular. These platforms provide temporary and flexible jobs for native speakers as tutors and allow language learners to have one-on-one speaking practices on demand, on which learners occasionally practice the language with different tutors. With such distributed tutorship, learners can hold flexible schedules and receive diverse feedback. However, learners face challenges in consistently tracking their learning progress because different tutors provide feedback from diverse standards and perspectives, and hardly refer to learners' previous experiences with other tutors. We present RLens, a visualization system for facilitating learners' learning progress reflection by grouping different tutors' feedback, tracking how each feedback type has been addressed across learning sessions, and visualizing the learning progress. We validate our design through a between-subjects study with 40 real-world learners. Results show that learners can successfully analyze their progress and common language issues under distributed tutorship with RLens, while most learners using the baseline interface had difficulty achieving reflection tasks. We further discuss design considerations of computer-aided systems for supporting learning under distributed tutorship. © 2022 ACM.",,,,,,100,RLens: A Computer-aided Visualization System for Supporting Reflection on Language Learning under Distributed Tutorship,Xia M.;

Digital Education For All: Multi-University Study of Increasing Competent Student Admissions at Scale,2022,Full Paper,Academics @ Scale,"An indubitable way to put learning at scale in practice is to implement Massive Open Online Courses, or MOOCs. When a wide-enough portfolio of them is available, new applications arise. For instance, university admissions in Finland, where this study was conducted, have traditionally been based on students' grades in high school studies, an entrance examination, or a combination of both. A minority of students have been accepted through an open university admission path where students can get a study right if they complete enough university course credits with a high enough grade in a given time frame. In this work, we report results from a multi-university project in which the open university admission path has been expanded. All the universities in the Digital Education For All (DEFA) project remarkably expanded their portfolio of MOOCs that were offered both openly and for free, and the new admission path was simultaneously actively marketed and modified. In our analysis, we focus on examining whether the project increased computer science enrolments in the participating universities and how students accepted through the project perform in their studies compared to their peers accepted through other, traditional intake paths. © 2022 ACM.",,,,,,100,Digital Education For All: Multi-University Study of Increasing Competent Student Admissions at Scale,Pirttinen N.; Leinonen J.; Auvinen A.; Lappalainen V.; Tynkkynen K.; Hedberg H.; Laakso M.-J.; Lemström K.,"Pirttinen, Nea (57200299897); Leinonen, Juho (57156123300); Auvinen, Annemari (15623054000); Lappalainen, Vesa (6603032946); Tynkkynen, Katja (6507901112); Hedberg, Henrik (22979798200); Laakso, Mikko-Jussi (19639011200); Lemström, Kjell (7006564183)",57200299897; 57156123300; 15623054000; 6603032946; 6507901112; 22979798200; 19639011200; 7006564183,Digital Education For All: Multi-University Study of Increasing Competent Student Admissions at Scale,2022.0,L@S 2022 - Proceedings of the 9th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,72,81,9.0,0.0,10.1145/3491140.3528266,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132180912&doi=10.1145%2f3491140.3528266&partnerID=40&md5=869f6cb48761f4a42d377116a9896b85,"University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland; University of Jyväskylä, Jyväskylä, Finland; University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland; University of Turku, Turku, Finland","Pirttinen N., University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland; Leinonen J., University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland; Auvinen A., University of Jyväskylä, Jyväskylä, Finland; Lappalainen V., University of Jyväskylä, Jyväskylä, Finland; Tynkkynen K., University of Jyväskylä, Jyväskylä, Finland; Hedberg H., University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland; Laakso M.-J., University of Turku, Turku, Finland; Lemström K., University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland",admission policies; intake mechanisms; MOOCs; retention in computer science; student admissions; student intake,E-learning; Education computing; Admission policies; Intake mechanism; Massive open online course; MOOC; New applications; Open universities; Retention in computer science; Student admission; Student intake; University admissions; Students,,,,,"Opetus- ja Kulttuuriministeriö, (OKM/248/523/2017)",Students in Finland may receive twofold financial support during their studies: a monthly grant and a government-guaranteed loan.

This positioning between MOOCs and degrees raises interesting questions regarding retention: MOOCs are famous for their low completion rates, but accredited degree programs often strive for high retention rates. This paper aims to answer the broad question: what does retention look like in a ""MOOC-based""degree program? To answer this question, we analyze retention at two levels: first at the program level, then at the course level. We find that retention is far higher than in MOOCs, but notably lower than in traditional in-person programs, both when looking at the program as a whole and at individual courses. We provide discuss several hypotheses for this phenomenon, as well as implications for program evaluation and course design. © 2022 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,"Meet Me in the Middle: Retention in a ""MOOC-Based"" Degree Program",Joyner D.A.,"Joyner, David A.

Function Names: Quantifying the Relationship Between Identifiers and Their Functionality to Improve Them,2022,Full Paper,CS Education @ Scale,"When students first learn to program, they often focus on functionality: does a program work? In an era where software volume and complexity increase exponentially, it is equally important that they learn to write programs with style so that they are readable and extendable. Writing quality code starts with the building blocks for any program, its functions. A carefully chosen name is vital for program maintainability and manageability. The identifier is the most portable and concise way to summarize what the function does. What makes for the right choice? And can we automatically assess the quality of function names? Using natural language processing, we were able to create a probabilistic model to evaluate their clarity. Using functionality encodings, we attempt to learn the relationship between functions in different programs to improve their names. We analyzed a total of 5,400 programs tackling five novice programming tasks submitted by over 1,000 students in CS1. We developed a software system to automate labor-intensive tasks, detect poor function names and recommend replacements. Our findings suggest that less than 2.5% of name substitutions have an adverse outcome, and in most cases, more than 50% result in an improvement. © 2022 ACM.",,,,,,100,Function Names: Quantifying the Relationship Between Identifiers and Their Functionality to Improve Them,Charitsis C.; Piech C.; Mitchell J.C.,"Charitsis, Charis (57224625901); Piech, Chris (55142243300); Mitchell, John C.

LEGenT: Localizing Errors and Generating Testcases for CS1,2022,Full Paper,CS Education @ Scale,"In a CS1 course, testcases are the most common way of providing feedback. However, manually designed testcases, even if carefully crafted, may miss out on certain crucial corner cases. These testcases are only generated once for the whole class and do not take into account errors generated by specific students. This paper presents LEGenT, an automated tool that generates personalized testcases for student submission. LEGenT first localizes a statement in the program that causes deviation from the expected behaviour. Then it generates testcases that expose the deviation to the student. Our premise is that such a targeted test would help students identify one of the early reasons for the deviation. LEGenT works by separating buggy programs from the correct ones using an off-the-shelf formal equivalence checker. It uses another off-the-shelf tool to cluster buggy as well as correct programs. It aligns an incorrect program cluster with a nearby correct program cluster to generate relevant testcases for the incorrect program. We have evaluated our technique on 26082 (2764 correct + 23318 buggy) real student submissions across 11 different programming problems. LEGenT was able to localize an erroneous statement and generated testcases for 7696 buggy submissions. LEGenT fails to generate a testcase when the buggy submission is nowhere close to any correct submission. For the cases where LEGenT successfully generated testcases, we use a novel validation method to prove its accuracy, that LEGenT correctly identifies a cause of deviation from the correct behaviour. © 2022 ACM.",,,,,,100,LEGenT: Localizing Errors and Generating Testcases for CS1,Agarwal N.; Karkare A.,"Agarwal, Nimisha (57214481793); Karkare, Amey (7801322507)",57214481793; 7801322507,LEGenT: Localizing Errors and Generating Testcases for CS1,2022.0,L@S 2022 - Proceedings of the 9th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,102,112,10.0,2.0,10.1145/3491140.3528282,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132171562&doi=10.1145%2f3491140.3528282&partnerID=40&md5=69a63a1811b6e056a7fbf349a1006c20,"Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, India","Agarwal N., Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, India; Karkare A., Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, India",automated feedback; clustering; CS1; error localization; targeted testcases; testcase generation,Errors; Software testing; Automated feedback; Automated tools; Clusterings; Corner case; Equivalence checker; Error localization; Programming problem; Targeted testcase; Test case; Test case generation; Students,,,,,,,"Adu-Manu K., Arthur J., Amoako P., Causes of Failure of Students in Computer Programming Courses: The Teacher Learner Perspective, International Journal of Computer Applications, 77, pp. 27-32, (2013); Ahmad R., Sarlan A., Sobri Hashim A., Fadzil Hassan M., Relationship between Hands-on and Written Coursework Assessments with Critical Thinking Skills in Structured Programming Course, 2017 7th World Engineering Education Forum (WEEF).

Nonetheless, it is perceived as the most challenging programming skill for learners to master. Researchers have studied decomposition in introductory programming courses through guided experiments, case studies, and surveys. We believe that the rapid advancements in scientific fields such as machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) opened up opportunities for more scalable approaches. We study the relationship between problem-related entities and functional decomposition. We use an automated system to collect 78,500 code snapshots from two CS1 programming assignments of 250 students and then apply NLP techniques to quantify the learner's ability to break down a problem into a series of smaller, more straightforward tasks. We compare different behaviors and evaluate at scale the impact of decomposition on the time it takes to deliver the solution, its complexity, and the student's performance in the assignment and the course exams. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for teaching and future research. © 2022 ACM.",,,,,,100,Using NLP to Quantify Program Decomposition in CS1,Charitsis C.; Piech C.; Mitchell J.C.,"Charitsis, Charis (57224625901); Piech, Chris (55142243300); Mitchell, John C.

Large-Scale Student Data Reveal Sociodemographic Gaps in Procrastination Behavior,2022,Full Paper,Studies @ Scale,"University students have to manage complex and demanding schedules to keep up with coursework across multiple classes while navigating formative personal, cultural, and financial events. Procrastination, the act of deferring study effort until the task deadline, is therefore a prevalent phenomenon, but whether it is more common among historically disadvantaged students is unknown. If systematic differences in procrastination behavior exist across sociodemographic groups, they may also contribute to achievement gaps, considering that procrastination is largely negatively associated with academic performance in prior research. We therefore investigate these questions in the context of assignment submission using campus-wide learning management system (LMS) data from a large U.S. research university. We analyze 2,631,893 submission records by 25,659 students across 2,153 courses and propose a context-agnostic procrastination score for each student in each course based on their assignment submission times relative to classmates. Based on this procrastination score, we find significantly higher levels of procrastination behavior among males, racial minorities, and first-generation college students than their peers. However, these differences only explain performance gaps to a very limited extent and the negative association between procrastination behavior and performance remains relatively stable across student groups. This large-scale behavioral study advances the understanding of academic procrastination through an equity lens and informs the development of scalable interventions to mitigate the negative effects of procrastination. © 2022 ACM.",,,,,,100,Large-Scale Student Data Reveal Sociodemographic Gaps in Procrastination Behavior,Sabnis S.; Yu R.; Kizilcec R.F.,"Sabnis, Sunil (57747976500); Yu, Renzhe (57203392525); Kizilcec, René F.

Meta Transfer Learning for Early Success Prediction in MOOCs,2022,Full Paper,Studies @ Scale,"Despite the increasing popularity of massive open online courses (MOOCs), many suffer from high dropout and low success rates. Early prediction of student success for targeted intervention is therefore essential to ensure no student is left behind in a course. There exists a large body of research in success prediction for MOOCs, focusing mainly on training models from scratch for individual courses. This setting is impractical in early success prediction as the performance of a student is only known at the end of the course. In this paper, we aim to create early success prediction models that can be transferred between MOOCs from different domains and topics. To do so, we present three novel strategies for transfer: 1) pre-training a model on a large set of diverse courses, 2) leveraging the pre-trained model by including meta information about courses, and 3) fine-tuning the model on previous course iterations. Our experiments on 26 MOOCs with over 145,000 combined enrollments and millions of interactions show that models combining interaction data and course information have comparable or better performance than models which have access to previous iterations of the course.

Millions and Billions of Views: Understanding Popular Science and Knowledge Communication on Video-Sharing Platforms,2022,Full Paper,Video Use @ Scale,"Science and knowledge communication is the process of informing and engaging the public about a diverse array of topics, such as science, health, philosophy, and history. Effective science and knowledge communication is challenging because communicators need to balance several factors, such as the complexity of topics, viewers' diverse backgrounds, and the characteristics of the medium. With the widespread availability of design tools and platforms to create and share content, laypeople can disseminate knowledge widely through online platforms. Popular science and knowledge communication video channels on YouTube, for example, have millions or tens of millions of subscribers, as well as millions or billions of accumulated views. Even with the growing popularity of science and knowledge communication videos, there is little understanding of the practices the creators use to make and increase the reach of their videos, the challenges they encounter while doing so, and how these videos impact viewers. This paper reports on interviews conducted with 27 creators of popular science and knowledge communication videos on YouTube and 13 viewers of these creators' videos. We present the motivations of creators and viewers, the practices creators use for broad science and knowledge communication, and the challenges encountered by members of the community. © 2022 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,Millions and Billions of Views: Understanding Popular Science and Knowledge Communication on Video-Sharing Platforms,Xia H.; Ng H.X.; Chen Z.; Hollan J.,"Xia, Haijun (56427427600); Ng, Hui Xin (57748637800); Chen, Zhutian (57189640527); Hollan, James (6602750503)",56427427600; 57748637800; 57189640527; 6602750503,Millions and Billions of Views: Understanding Popular Science and Knowledge Communication on Video-Sharing Platforms,2022.0,L@S 2022 - Proceedings of the 9th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,163,174,11.0,4.0,10.1145/3491140.3528279,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132155186&doi=10.1145%2f3491140.3528279&partnerID=40&md5=c14c618d1fc7cced01d101b7cb2c56a2,"University of California, San Diego, CA, United States","Xia H., University of California, San Diego, CA, United States; Ng H.X., University of California, San Diego, CA, United States; Chen Z., University of California, San Diego, CA, United States; Hollan J., University of California, San Diego, CA, United States",informal learning; online learning; science and knowledge communication; science communication; video-based learning,Availability; Communication video; Informal learning; Knowledge communication; Online learning; Science communications; Sharing platforms; Video sharing; Video-based learning; YouTube; E-learning,,,,,,,"3Blue1Brown; Amarasekara I., Grant W.J., Exploring the YouTube Science Communication Gender Gap: A Sentiment Analysis., Public Understanding of Science, 28, 1, pp. 68-84; The World of Science Blogging, 2017; Aksakal N., Theoretical view to the approach of the edutainment, Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 186, pp. 1232-1239, (2015); BBC Radio 4-BBC Inside Science.

Picturing One's Self: Camera Use in Zoom Classes during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2022,Full Paper,Video Use @ Scale,"Starting from the spring of 2020, higher institutions in the US underwent a rapid shift from in-person classes to emergency remote education, in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Under this circumstance, a variety of video conferencing tools (e.g., Zoom) have been adopted for distance education, which pose a set of new challenges arising from synchronous online classes. Among these, one significant issue was students' unwillingness to open cameras, resulting in a lack of non-verbal cues that instructors could rely on to gauge students' understanding and adjust their teachings. Towards addressing this issue, our qualitative study aims at investigating the rationales behind students' camera avoidance. Through a series of semi-structured interviews on undergraduate students in the U.S, we identified prominent factors - namely the class size, lecture style, level of interactivity and privacy concerns - that influenced students' motivation for opening their cameras. At the same time, we uncovered several difficulties, such as heightened self-awareness, feeling of minority and academic perspective, that discouraged students from opening camera, with more substantial impacts on international students. We conclude with actionable insights into the design of online classes, video-conferencing platforms and camera technology that can promote camera usage, thereby contributing to scalable and inclusive interventions for facilitating the transition into remote education. © 2022 ACM.",,,,,,100,Picturing One's Self: Camera Use in Zoom Classes during the COVID-19 Pandemic,Li N.; Romera Rodriguez G.; Xu Y.; Bhatt P.; Nguyen H.A.; Serpi A.; Tsai C.; Carroll J.M.,"Li, Na (57226000310); Romera Rodriguez, Guillermo (57748302200); Xu, Yuqiao (57746686400); Bhatt, Parth (57747007200); Nguyen, Huy A.

Using the YouTube Video Style in a MOOC: (Re-)Testing the Effect of Visual Experience in a Field-Experiment,2022,Full Paper,Video Use @ Scale,"Whether a lecturer presence helps or hinders in audio-visual learning material has been raised numerous times. While previous research found no substantial evidence in favor of a lecturer presence in controlled eye-tracking experiments, the given study analyzes results of a field-experiment in a German MOOC with 2,938 active participants taking a four-week course on data structures and algorithms. The research team produced specific content for this experiment with the goal to compare traditional slide-lectures with a modern explainer video style as seen on major video platforms. These two treatment groups are identical on the audio track and truly only differ in terms of the visual experience of the lecture on recursion. The variables are: 1) Perception of a learner defined by content, the speaker and his/her own learning and 2) Scores of a recall and transfer assessment. The first variable is conducted by a user survey (n=490), the skill assessment is measured by two posttests (quiz & programming task). The findings indicate a different perception of the speaker's focus, a significant better evaluation of the lecturer condition and higher scores on the recall posttest. No difference is seen in the perceived degree of professionalism, the self-reported level of attention and the scores of the transfer task. By testing and replicating previous findings in a real MOOC setting with adult learners, the given study contributes to the research of video-based learning in general, and to the sub-topic of effective teaching settings for computer science concepts in scaling environments. © 2022 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,Using the YouTube Video Style in a MOOC: (Re-)Testing the Effect of Visual Experience in a Field-Experiment,Steinbeck H.; Zobel T.; Meinel C.,"Steinbeck, Hendrik (57215899166); Zobel, Theresa (57351645600); Meinel, Christoph (56187776800)",57215899166; 57351645600; 56187776800,Using the YouTube Video Style in a MOOC: (Re-)Testing the Effect of Visual Experience in a Field-Experiment,2022.0,L@S 2022 - Proceedings of the 9th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,142,150,8.0,2.0,10.1145/3491140.3528268,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132159372&doi=10.1145%2f3491140.3528268&partnerID=40&md5=6dbf507d3173f688b2d3034ebb079da4,"Hasso Plattner Institute, Potsdam, Germany","Steinbeck H., Hasso Plattner Institute, Potsdam, Germany; Zobel T., Hasso Plattner Institute, Potsdam, Germany; Meinel C., Hasso Plattner Institute, Potsdam, Germany",lecturer presence; production styles; video instruction; YouTube explainer video,Audio-visual; Field experiment; Learning materials; Lecturer presence; Production style; Video instructions; Visual experiences; Visual learning; YouTube; Youtube explainer video; Eye tracking,,,,,,,"Apostolidis E., Adamantidou E., Mezaris V., Patras I., Combining Adversarial and Reinforcement Learning for Video Thumbnail Selection, Proceedings of the 2021 International Conference on Multimedia Retrieval.

"Designing and Building Inclusive, Entry-level Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs): Perspectives from Producers",2022,Full Paper,Instructional Design @ Scale,"Persistent calls have been made for more investigation into the actors producing MOOCs and their design processes [30, 45, 51, 22]. In this paper, a series of semi-structured interviews are conducted on a set of MOOC producers from a major research university in the United States building entry-level MOOCs. The interviews focus on how these producers are considering traditionally underrepresented learners and the challenges these students may face throughout the design process. The interviews and analysis contribute several observations. First, diverse conceptions of inclusion reflect a sincere normative commitment on the part of the producers to make inclusive MOOCs, though the conceptions were quite distinct. Second, producers were intentional about utilising best-practice pedagogical methods, as well as innovative program design, to include as many learners as possible. Finally, innovative technology partners helped create interactive, unique experiences, but this also led to challenges in harmonising the design process and required the considerable influence of 'third-space' actors [54]. © 2022 ACM.",,,,,,100,"Designing and Building Inclusive, Entry-level Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs): Perspectives from Producers",Meaney M.J.,"Meaney, Michael Joseph (57748962700)",57748962700,"Designing and Building Inclusive, Entry-level Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs): Perspectives from Producers",2022.0,L@S 2022 - Proceedings of the 9th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,189,199,10.0,0.0,10.1145/3491140.3528281,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132140289&doi=10.1145%2f3491140.3528281&partnerID=40&md5=b74696d986eed4bf891ad8f32175f460,"Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, United States","Meaney M.J., Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, United States",inclusive education; learning design; massive open online courses (MOOCs),Architectural design; E-learning; Best practices; Design-process; Inclusive education; Learning designs; Massive open online course; Normative commitments; Pedagogical method; Research universities; Semi structured interviews; Curricula,,,,,Gates Cambridge Trust,"Funding for this project was provided, in part, by the Gates Cambridge Trust.

When Gamification Spoils Your Learning: A Qualitative Case Study of Gamification Misuse in a Language-Learning App,2022,Full Paper,Instructional Design @ Scale,"More and more learning apps like Duolingo are using some form of gamification (e.g., badges, points, and leaderboards) to enhance user learning. However, they are not always successful. Gamification misuse is a phenomenon that occurs when users become too fixated on gamification and get distracted from learning. This undesirable phenomenon wastes users' precious time and negatively impacts their learning performance. However, there has been little research in the literature to understand gamification misuse and inform future gamification designs. Therefore, this paper aims to fill this knowledge gap by conducting the first extensive qualitative research on gamification misuse in a popular learning app called Duolingo. Duolingo is currently the world's most downloaded learning app used to learn languages. This study consists of two phases: (I)a content analysis of data from Duolingo forums (from the past nine years) and (II)semi-structured interviews with 15 international Duolingo users. Our research contributes to the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Learning at Scale (L@S) research communities in three ways: (1) elaborating the ramifications of gamification misuse on user learning, well-being, and ethics, (2) identifying the most common reasons for gamification misuse (e.g., competitiveness, overindulgence in playfulness, and herding), and (3) providing designers with practical suggestions to prevent (or mitigate) the occurrence of gamification misuse in their future designs of gamified learning apps. © 2022 ACM.",,,,,,100,When Gamification Spoils Your Learning: A Qualitative Case Study of Gamification Misuse in a Language-Learning App,Hadi Mogavi R.; Guo B.; Zhang Y.; Haq E.-U.; Hui P.; Ma X.,"Hadi Mogavi, Reza (57223128215); Guo, Bingcan (57574366100); Zhang, Yuanhao (57574710200); Haq, Ehsan-Ul (57205283169); Hui, Pan (14029922900); Ma, Xiaojuan (56242668800)",57223128215; 57574366100; 57574710200; 57205283169; 14029922900; 56242668800,When Gamification Spoils Your Learning: A Qualitative Case Study of Gamification Misuse in a Language-Learning App,2022.0,L@S 2022 - Proceedings of the 9th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,175,188,13.0,4.0,10.1145/3491140.3528274,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132190149&doi=10.1145%2f3491140.3528274&partnerID=40&md5=a2e19fa16249dddf7e6f53218151c91a,"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, Hong Kong; University of Helsinki, Hong Kong SAR, Hong Kong","Hadi Mogavi R., Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, Hong Kong; Guo B., Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, Hong Kong; Zhang Y., Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, Hong Kong; Haq E.-U., Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, Hong Kong; Hui P., Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, University of Helsinki, Hong Kong SAR, Hong Kong; Ma X., Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, Hong Kong",duolingo; gamification; gamified education; HCI; L@S; learning app; misuse; qualitative research; student-centered education,E-learning; Duolingo; Gamification; Gamified education; Language learning; Learning app; Learning at scale; Misuse; Qualitative case studies; Qualitative research; Student-centred education; Human computer interaction,,,,,"Academy of Finland, AKA; Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee, 研究資助局, (T44-707/16-N)","We would like to thank Duolingo and all of our research participants who made this study possible.

Digital Clinical Simulation Suite: Specifications and Architecture for Simulation-Based Pedagogy at Scale,2022,Full Paper,Simulations and Games @ Scale,"Role-plays of interpersonal interactions are essential to learning across professions, but effective simulations are difficult to create in typical learning management systems. To empower educators and researchers to advance simulation-based pedagogy, we have developed the Digital Clinical Simulation Suite (DCSS, pronounced ""decks""), an open-source platform for rehearsing for improvisational interactions. Participants are immersed in vignettes of professional practice through video, images, and text, and they are called upon to improvisationally make difficult decisions through recorded audio and text. Tailored data displays support participant reflection, instructional facilitation, and educational research. DCSS is based on six design principles: 1) Community Adaptation, 2) Masked Technical Complexity, 3) Authenticity of Task, 4) Improvisational Voice, 5) Data Access through ""5Rs"", and 6) Extensible AI Coaching. These six principles mean that any educator should be able to create a scenario that learners should engage in authentic professional challenges using ordinary computing devices, and learners and educators should have access to data for reflection, facilitation, and development of AI tools for real-time feedback. In this paper, we describe the architecture of DCSS and illustrate its use and efficacy in cases from online courses, colleges of education, and K-12 schools. © 2022 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,Digital Clinical Simulation Suite: Specifications and Architecture for Simulation-Based Pedagogy at Scale,Hillaire G.; Waldron R.; Littenberg-Tobias J.; Thompson M.; O'Brien S.; Marvez G.R.; Reich J.,"Hillaire, Garron (57053548200); Waldron, Rick (57746695800); Littenberg-Tobias, Joshua (57056479100); Thompson, Meredith (57205744232); O'Brien, Sara (57748618800); Marvez, G.R.

The Challenges of Evolving Technical Courses at Scale: Four Case Studies of Updating Large Data Science Courses,2022,Full Paper,Simulations and Games @ Scale,"Instructors who teach large-scale technical courses, especially on data science and programming, must do a large amount of logistical work when updating their courses. All of this behind-the-scenes labor takes time away from the pedagogically-meaningful work of teaching students. Over the past five years, the authors of this paper have created and updated eight courses for an undergraduate data science program that serves over 2,000 students per year. We present four case studies from our teaching experiences that highlight major challenges in maintaining and updating technical courses: 1) There were intricate dependencies between course materials, so making updates to one part of the course would require updating many other parts. 2) We needed to maintain several variants of course materials such as assignments. 3) We wrote large amounts of ad-hoc custom software infrastructure to manage logistics. 4) We could not easily reuse software written by others. Our case studies point to design ideas for instructor-oriented tools that can reduce the logistical complexities of teaching at scale, thus letting instructors focus on the substance of teaching rather than on mundane logistics. © 2022 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,The Challenges of Evolving Technical Courses at Scale: Four Case Studies of Updating Large Data Science Courses,Lau S.; Eldridge J.; Ellis S.; Fraenkel A.; Langlois M.; Rampure S.; Tiefenbruck J.; Guo P.J.,"Lau, Sam (57209780432); Eldridge, Justin (56865540500); Ellis, Shannon (55963526300); Fraenkel, Aaron (57747343800); Langlois, Marina (23393290300); Rampure, Suraj (57222587275); Tiefenbruck, Janine (56940768300); Guo, Philip J.

Learnersourcing in Theory and Practice: Synthesizing the Literature and Charting the Future,2022,Full Paper,Students @ Scale,"Given the growing interest in learnersourcing - a pedagogically supported form of crowdsourcing that harnesses the knowledge and creativity of learners for the creation of learning resources - we propose a theoretical framework to study, design, and deploy learnersourcing systems. By integrating ideas from crowdsourcing and learning theories focusing on learner-centered pedagogy, this work provides a review and classification of learnersourcing systems from the perspective of its three groups of stakeholders: (1) contributors, who are the learners who contribute new learning artifacts, (2) beneficiaries, who are the learners who learn from these artifacts, and (3) the instructional team who design and deploy learnersourcing tasks. The framework serves as a heuristic device for designing new learnersourcing systems and for considering the broader implications for learnersourcing in terms of workflow design, incentivizing contributors, quality-control, learning outcomes, delivering personalized learning experiences, ethical considerations, and its complementary relationship with AI in education. © 2022 ACM.",,,,,,100,Learnersourcing in Theory and Practice: Synthesizing the Literature and Charting the Future,Singh A.; Brooks C.; Doroudi S.,"Singh, Anjali (57221149159); Brooks, Christopher (14047887300); Doroudi, Shayan (57190766981)",57221149159; 14047887300; 57190766981,Learnersourcing in Theory and Practice: Synthesizing the Literature and Charting the Future,2022.0,L@S 2022 - Proceedings of the 9th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,234,245,11.0,7.0,10.1145/3491140.3528277,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132171215&doi=10.1145%2f3491140.3528277&partnerID=40&md5=3be5210a59232f26e26aab28e9bd6aa4,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States; University of California, Irvine, CA, United States","Singh A., University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States; Brooks C., University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States; Doroudi S., University of California, Irvine, CA, United States",design implications; learnersourcing; meta-analysis; theoretical framework,Learning systems; Quality control; Design implications; Learner-centred; Learnersourcing; Learning artifacts; Learning resource; Learning Theory; Meta-analysis; Study design; Theoretical framework; Theory and practice; Crowdsourcing,,,,,,,"Abdi S., Khosravi H., Sadiq S., Demartini G., Evaluating the quality of learning resources: A learnersourcing approach, IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies, 14, 1, pp. 81-92, (2021); Alexander P.A., The development of expertise: The journey from acclimation to proficiency, Educational researcher, 32, 8, pp. 10-14, (2003); Baeza-Yates R., Data and algorithmic bias in the web, Proceedings of the 8th ACM Conference on Web Science, (2016); Barak M., Rafaeli S., On-line question-posing and peerassessment as means for web-based knowledge sharing in learning, International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, 61, 1, pp. 84-103, (2004); Bates S.P., Galloway R.K., McBride K.L., Student-generated content: Using PeerWise to enhance engagement and outcomes in introductory physics courses, AIP Conference Proceedings, 1413, pp. 123-126, (2012); Bernstein M.S., Little G., Miller R.C., Hartmann B., Ackerman M.S., Karger D.R., Crowell D., Panovich K., Soylent: A word processor with a crowd inside, Proceedings of the 23nd annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology, pp. 313-322, (2010); Bhatanagar S., Zouaq A., Desmarais M.C., Charles E., A Dataset of Learnersourced Explanations from an Online Peer Instruction Environment, International Educational Data Mining Society, (2020); Bhatnagar S., Lasry N., Desmarais M., Charles E., Dalite: Asynchronous peer instruction for moocs, European Conference on Technology Enhanced Learning, pp. 505-508, (2016); Bhatnagar S., Zouaq A., Desmarais M.C., Charles E., Learnersourcing Quality Assessment of Explanations for Peer Instruction, European Conference on Technology Enhanced Learning, pp. 144-157, (2020); Brooks C., Quintana R.M., Choi H., Quintana C., NeCamp T., Gardner J., Towards culturally relevant personalization at scale: Experiments with data science learners, International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 31, 3, pp. 516-537, (2021); Brooks C., Thompson C., Teasley S., A time series interaction analysis method for building predictive models of learners using log data, Proceedings of the fifth international conference on learning analytics and knowledge, pp. 126-135, (2015); Butler D.L., Winne P.H., Feedback and self-regulated learning: A theoretical synthesis, Review of educational research, 65, 3, pp. 245-281, (1995); Cesa-Bianchi N., Gentile C., Zappella G., A gang of bandits, Advances in neural information processing systems, 26, (2013); Chevalier J.M., Buckles D.J., Participatory action research: Theory and methods for engaged inquiry, Routledge, (2013); Denny P., Hamer J., Luxton-Reilly A., Purchase H., PeerWise: Students sharing their multiple choice questions, Proceedings of the fourth international workshop on computing education research, pp. 51-58, (2008); Denny P., Luxton-Reilly A., Hamer J., The PeerWise system of student contributed assessment questions, Proceedings of the tenth conference on Australasian computing education-Volume 78.

Pathways: Exploring Academic Interests with Historical Course Enrollment Records,2022,Full Paper,Students @ Scale,"Students are encouraged to explore their interests during college to stimulate intellectual growth and prepare for a dynamic labor market. However, interest exploration is entangled with the fateful process of choosing courses for enrollment, and most institutions offer limited tools to help students choose. We propose Pathways, an interactive course information retrieval tool that facilitates interest exploration and course discovery with a diverse pool of historical course enrollment records. The tool visualizes sequences of course enrollments as ""academic pathways""to grant students unprecedented insights into the academic choices of prior students. We share our design process, including a formative study on need analysis, the UX and algorithm design, and an evaluation study. We find that Pathways supports students in finding courses that both match their interests and expose them to new ideas. We discuss directions for future work on how interest exploration can be promoted at scale and on how to utilize historical course enrollment data through visualization. © 2022 ACM.",,,,,,100,Pathways: Exploring Academic Interests with Historical Course Enrollment Records,Chen Y.; Fu A.; Lee J.J.-L.; Tomasik I.W.; Kizilcec R.F.,"Chen, Youjie (57203386946); Fu, Annie (57746676400); Lee, Jennifer Jia-Ling (57746676500); Tomasik, Ian Wilkie (57747325200); Kizilcec, René F.

$1 Conversational Turn Detector: Measuring How Video Conversations Affect Student Learning in Online Classes,2016,Full Paper,Learner Modelling,"Massive online classes can benefit from peer interactions such as discussion, critique, or tutoring. However, to scaffold productive peer interactions, systems must be able to detect student behavior in interactions at scale, which is challenging when interactions occur over rich media like video. This paper introduces an imprecise yet simple browser-based conversational turn detector for video conversations. Turns are detected without accessing video or audio data. We show how this turn detector can find dominance in video-based conversations. In a case study with 1,027 students using Talkabout, a video-based discussion system for online classes, we show how detected conversational turn behavior correlates with participants' subjective experience in discussions and their final course grade.",,,,,,100,$1 conversational turn detector: Measuring how video conversations affect student learning in online classes,Stankiewicz A.;

A Data-Driven Approach for Inferring Student Proficiency from Game Activity Logs,2016,Full Paper,Automated Assessment,"Student assessments are important because they allow collecting evidence about learning. However, time spent on evaluating students may be otherwise used for instructional activities. Computer-based learning platforms provide the opportunity for unobtrusively gathering students' digital learning footprints. This data can be used to track learning progress and make inference about student competencies. We present a novel data analysis pipeline, Student Proficiency Inferrer from Game data (SPRING), that allows modeling game playing behavior in educational games. Unlike prior work, SPRING is a fully data-driven method that does not require costly domain knowledge engineering. Moreover, it produces a simple interpretable model that not only fits the data but also predicts learning outcomes. We validate our framework using data collected from students playing 11 educational mini-games. Our results suggest that SPRING can predict math assessments accurately on withheld test data (Correlation=0.55, Spearman ρ=0.51).

"A Preliminary Look at MOOC-associated Facebook Groups: Prevalence, Geographic Representation, and Homophily",2016,WIP,Work in Progress,"Although xMOOCs are not designed to directly engage students via social media platforms, some students in these courses join MOOC-associated Facebook groups. This study explores the prevalence of Facebook groups associated with courses from MITx and HarvardX, the geographic distribution of students in such groups as compared to the courses at large, and the extent to which such groups are location and/or language homophilous. Results suggests that a non-trivial number of MOOC students engage in Facebook groups, that learners from a number of non-U.S. locations are disproportionately likely to participate in such groups, and that the groups display both location and language homophily. These findings have implications for how MOOCs and social media platforms can support learners from non-English speaking contexts.",,,,,,100,"A preliminary look at MOOC-associated Facebook groups: Prevalence, geographic representation, and homophily",Kasunic A.; Hammer J.; Kraut R.; Massimi M.; Ogan A.,"Kasunic, Anna (55632278700); Hammer, Jessica (56597500700); Kraut, Robert (7005796597); Massimi, Michael (16031488000); Ogan, Amy (22433477900)",55632278700; 56597500700; 7005796597; 16031488000; 22433477900,"A preliminary look at MOOC-associated Facebook groups: Prevalence, geographic representation, and homophily",2016.0,L@S 2016 - Proceedings of the 3rd 2016 ACM Conference on Learning at Scale,,,,205,208,3.0,4.0,10.1145/2876034.2893415,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84970004003&doi=10.1145%2f2876034.2893415&partnerID=40&md5=5ed91a85449b4c784504e47ef9ca03b5,"Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, 15213, PA, United States; Facebook, Menlo Park, 94025, CA, United States","Kasunic A., Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, 15213, PA, United States; Hammer J., Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, 15213, PA, United States; Kraut R., Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, 15213, PA, United States; Massimi M., Facebook, Menlo Park, 94025, CA, United States; Ogan A., Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, 15213, PA, United States",Facebook; Homophily; Massive open online courses; MOOCs; Social media,Computational linguistics; Education; Geographical distribution; Location; Students; Facebook; Homophily; Massive open online course; MOOCs; Social media; Social networking (online),,,,,,,"Alario-Hoyos C., Perez-Sanagustin M., Delgado-Kloos C., Hugo Parada G., Munoz-Organero M., Delving into participants' profiles and use of social tools in MOOCs, IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies, (2014); Cherukuru P., Agarwal A., Chandramouli K., Izquierdo E., Learner centric enhancement towards socio moodle,  World Conference on Continuing Engineering Education, 15, (2014); Greenhow C., Lewin C., Social media and education: Reconceptualizing the boundaries of formal and informal learning, Learning, Media and Technology, pp. 1-25, (2015); HarvardX, HarvardX Insights, (2015); Huang J., Dasgupta A., Ghosh A., Manning J., Sanders M., Superposter behavior in MOOC forums, Proceedings of the First ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale Conference - (L@S'14), pp. 117-126, (2014); MITx, HarvardX, MITx and HarvardX Dataverse, (2015); Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Project, Social Networking Popular Across Globe, (2012); Siemens G., Massive open online courses: Innovation in education?, Open Educational Resources: Innovation, Research and Practice, pp. 5-16, (2013); Yang D., Piergallini M., Howley I., Rose C., Forum thread recommendation for massive open online courses, Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Educational Data Mining, pp. 257-260, (2014)",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","ACM; edX; Google; Instructure, Inc.; Microsoft Research; Oracle Academy","3rd Annual ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2016",25 April 2016 through 26 April 2016,Edinburgh,121394.0,,978-145033726-7,,,English,LS - Proc.

A Queueing Network Model for Spaced Repetition,2016,WIP,Work in Progress,"Flashcards are a popular study tool for exploiting the spacing effect - the phenomenon in which periodic, spaced review of educational content improves long-term retention. The Leitner system is a simple heuristic algorithm for scheduling reviews such that forgotten items are reviewed more frequently than recalled items. We propose a formalization of the Leitner system as a queueing network model, and formulate optimal review scheduling as a throughput-maximization problem. Through simulations and theoretical analysis, we find that the Leitner Queue Network (LQN) model has desirable properties and gives insight into general principles for spaced repetition.

A Scalable Learning Analytics Platform for Automated Writing Feedback,2016,WIP,Work in Progress,"In this paper, we describe a scalable learning analytics platform which runs generalized analytics models on educational data in parallel. As a proof of concept, we use this platform as a base for an end-to-end automated writing feedback system. The system allows students to view feedback on their writing in near real-time, edit their writing based on the feedback provided, and observe the progression of their performance over time. Providing students with detailed feedback is an important part of improving writing skills and an essential component towards solving Bloom's ""two sigma"" problem in education. We evaluate the effectiveness of the feedback for students with an ongoing pilot study with 800 students who are using the learning analytics platform in a college English course.",,,,,,100,A scalable learning analytics platform for automated writing feedback,Lewkow N.; Feild J.; Zimmerman N.; Riedesel M.; Essa A.; Boulanger D.; Seanosky J.; Kinshuk V.K.; Kode S.,"Lewkow, Nicholas (55340451800); Feild, Jacqueline (57201722156); Zimmerman, Neil (57193766199); Riedesel, Mark (57189377905); Essa, Alfred (55330044600); Boulanger, David (56565054200); Seanosky, Jeremie (56565652000); Kinshuk, Vive Kumar (57201621048); Kode, Sandhya (36470543700)",55340451800; 57201722156; 57193766199; 57189377905; 55330044600; 56565054200; 56565652000; 57201621048; 36470543700,A scalable learning analytics platform for automated writing feedback,2016.0,L@S 2016 - Proceedings of the 3rd 2016 ACM Conference on Learning at Scale,,,,109,112,3.0,8.0,10.1145/2876034.2893380,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84970024952&doi=10.1145%2f2876034.2893380&partnerID=40&md5=4361258c6f90388246287833f4c52a95,"McGraw-Hill Education, Boston, MA, United States; Athabasca University, Edmonton, AB, Canada; IIIT Hyderabad, Hyderabad, India","Lewkow N., McGraw-Hill Education, Boston, MA, United States; Feild J., McGraw-Hill Education, Boston, MA, United States; Zimmerman N., McGraw-Hill Education, Boston, MA, United States; Riedesel M., McGraw-Hill Education, Boston, MA, United States; Essa A., McGraw-Hill Education, Boston, MA, United States; Boulanger D., Athabasca University, Edmonton, AB, Canada; Seanosky J., Athabasca University, Edmonton, AB, Canada; Kinshuk V.K., Athabasca University, Edmonton, AB, Canada; Kode S., IIIT Hyderabad, Hyderabad, India",Analytic tools for learners; Automatic essay feedback; Natural language processing; Performance feedback; Scalable analytics,Education; Education computing; Natural language processing systems; Analytic tools; College English; Detailed feedbacks; NAtural language processing; Performance feedback; Proof of concept; Scalable analytics; Writing feedbacks; Students,,,,,,,"Bloom B.S., The 2 sigma problem: The search for methods of group instruction as effective as one-to-one tutoring, Educational Researcher, pp. 4-16, (1984); Boulanger D., Et al., Scale: A competence analytics framework, State-of-the-Art and Future Directions of Smart Learning, pp. 19-30, (2016); Butler D.L., Winne P.H., Feedback and self-regulated learning: A theoretical synthesis, Review of Educational Research, 65, 3, pp. 245-281, (1995); Guo S., Fraser M.W., Propensity score analysis, Statistical Methods and Applications, 12, (2015); Hattie J., Timperley H., The power of feedback, Review of Educational Research, 77, 1, pp. 81-112, (2007); Kumar V., Et al., Mobile computing and mixed-initiative support for writing competence, Intelligent and Adaptive Learning Systems: Technology Enhanced Support for Learners and Teachers: Technology Enhanced Support for Learners and Teachers, (2011); Manning C.D., Et al., The stanford corenlp natural language processing toolkit, Proceedings of 52nd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: System Demonstrations, pp. 55-60, (2014); McNamara D.S., Et al., The writing-pal: Natural language algorithms to support intelligent tutoring on writing strategies, Applied Natural Language Processing and Content Analysis: Identification, Investigation, and Resolution, pp. 298-311, (2012); Nicol D.J., Macfarlane-Dick D., Formative assessment and self-regulated learning: A model and seven principles of good feedback practice, Studies in Higher Education, 31, 2, pp. 199-218, (2006); Pearson, The Research Behind Writetolearn, (2007); Turnitin, Turnitin Revision Assistant, (2015); Zimmerman B.J., Self-regulated learning and academic achievement: An overview, Educational Psychologist, 25, 1, pp. 3-17, (1990)",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","ACM; edX; Google; Instructure, Inc.; Microsoft Research; Oracle Academy","3rd Annual ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2016",25 April 2016 through 26 April 2016,Edinburgh,121394.0,,978-145033726-7,,,English,LS - Proc.

AXIS: Generating Explanations at Scale with Learnersourcing and Machine Learning,2016,Full Paper,Flipped Session - Crowdsourcing the Feedback,"While explanations may help people learn by providing information about why an answer is correct, many problems on online platforms lack high-quality explanations. This paper presents AXIS (Adaptive eXplanation Improvement System), a system for obtaining explanations. AXIS asks learners to generate, revise, and evaluate explanations as they solve a problem, and then uses machine learning to dynamically determine which explanation to present to a future learner, based on previous learners' collective input. Results from a case study deployment and a randomized experiment demonstrate that AXIS elicits and identifies explanations that learners find helpful. Providing explanations from AXIS also objectively enhanced learning, when compared to the default practice where learners solved problems and received answers without explanations. The rated quality and learning benefit of AXIS explanations did not differ from explanations generated by an experienced instructor.",,,,,,100,AXIS: Generating explanations at scale with learnersourcing and machine learning,Williams J.J.; Kim J.; Rafferty A.; Maldonado S.; Gajos K.Z.; Lasecki W.S.; Heffernan N.,"Williams, Joseph Jay (56159570600); Kim, Juho (39361826000); Rafferty, Anna (42361506800); Maldonado, Samuel (56159955100); Gajos, Krzysztof Z.

An Exploration of Automated Grading of Complex Assignments,2016,Full Paper,Automated Assessment,"Automated grading is essential for scaling up learning. In this paper, we conduct the first systematic study of how to automate grading of a complex assignment using a medical case assessment as a test case. We propose to solve this problem using a supervised learning approach and introduce three general complementary types of feature representations of such complex assignments for use in supervised learning. We first show with empirical experiments that it is feasible to automate grading of such assignments provided that the instructor can grade a number of examples. We further study how to integrate an automated grader with human grading and propose to frame the problem as learning to rank assignments to exploit pairwise preference judgments and use NDPM as a measure for evaluation of the accuracy of ranking. We then propose a sequential pairwise online active learning strategy to minimize the effort of human grading and optimize the collaboration of human graders and an automated grader. Experiment results show that this strategy is indeed effective and can substantially reduce human effort as compared with randomly sampling assignments for manual grading.",,,,,,100,An exploration of automated grading of complex assignments,Geigle C.; Zhai C.; Ferguson D.,"Geigle, Chase (55637377400); Zhai, Chengxiang (35232046000); Ferguson, Duncan (7402014469)",55637377400; 35232046000; 7402014469,An exploration of automated grading of complex assignments,2016.0,L@S 2016 - Proceedings of the 3rd 2016 ACM Conference on Learning at Scale,,,,351,360,9.0,16.0,10.1145/2876034.2876049,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84969988668&doi=10.1145%2f2876034.2876049&partnerID=40&md5=8ca6534889e4b3589515189e48f9af45,"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, United States","Geigle C., University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, United States; Zhai C., University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, United States; Ferguson D., University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, United States",Active learning; Automatic grading; Learning to rank; Ordinal regression; Supervised learning; Text mining,Artificial intelligence; Automation; Data mining; Supervised learning; Active Learning; Automatic grading; Learning to rank; Ordinal regression; Text mining; Grading,,,,,,,"Alur R., D'Antoni L., Gulwani S., Kini D., Viswanathan M., Automated grading of DFA constructions, (IJCAI), pp. 1976-1982, (2013); Balfour S.P., Assessing writing in MOOCs: Automated essay scoring and calibrated peer review, Research and Practice in Assessment, 8, 1, pp. 40-48, (2013); Brooks M., Basu S., Jacobs C., Vanderwende L., Divide and correct: Using clusters to grade short answers at scale, ACM L@S, pp. 89-98, (2014); Callison-Burch C., Fordyce C., Koehn P., Monz C., Schroeder J., (Meta-) evaluation of machine translation, WMT, pp. 136-158, (2007); Chu W., Keerthi S.S., Support vector ordinal regression, Neural Comput, 19, 3, pp. 792-815, (2007); Cortes C., Vapnik V., Support-vector networks, Mach.

To this end, we conducted an empirical study, where a lag sequential analysis was used to analyze behavior patterns.

Brain Points: A Deeper Look at a Growth Mindset Incentive Structure for an Educational Game,2016,Full Paper,Engagement,"Student retention is a central challenge in systems for learning at scale. It has been argued that educational video games could improve student retention by providing engaging experiences and informing the design of other online learning environments. However, educational games are not uniformly effective. Our recent research shows that player retention can be increased by using a brain points incentive structure that rewards behaviors associated with growth mindset, or the belief that intelligence can grow. In this paper, we expand on our prior work by providing new insights into how growth mindset behaviors can be effectively promoted in the educational game Refraction. We present results from an online study of 25,000 children who were exposed to five different versions of the brain points intervention. We find that growth mindset animations cause a large number of players to quit, while brain points encourage persistence. Most importantly, we find that awarding brain points randomly is ineffective; the incentive structure is successful specifically because it rewards desirable growth mindset behaviors. These findings have important implications that can support the future generalization of the brain points intervention to new educational contexts. © 2016 ACM.",,,,,,100,Brain points: A deeper look at a growth mindset incentive structure for an educational game,O'Rourke E.; Peach E.; Dweck C.S.; Popović Z.,"O'Rourke, Eleanor (36447934500); Peach, Erin (57189386236); Dweck, Carol S.

Browser Language Preferences as a Metric for Identifying ESL Speakers in MOOCs,2016,WIP,Work in Progress,"Open access and low cost make Massively Open Online Courses (MOOCs) an attractive learning platform for students all over the world. However, the majority of MOOCs are deployed in English, which can pose an accessibility problem for students with English as a Second Language (ESL). In order to design appropriate interventions for ESL speakers, it is important to correctly identify these students using a method that is scalable to the high number of MOOC enrollees.

Deep Neural Networks and How They Apply to Sequential Education Data,2016,WIP,Work in Progress,"Modern deep neural networks have achieved impressive results in a variety of automated tasks, such as text generation, grammar learning, and speech recognition. This paper discusses how education research might leverage recurrent neural network architectures in two small case studies. Specifically, we train a two-layer Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network on two distinct forms of education data: (1) essays written by students in a summative environment, and (2) MOOC clickstream data. Without any features specified beforehand, the network attempts to learn the underlying structure of the input sequences. After training, the model can be used generatively to produce new sequences with the same underlying patterns exhibited by the input distribution.

Effects of In-Video Quizzes on MOOC Lecture Viewing,2016,Full Paper,Engagement,"Online courses on sites such as Coursera use quizzes embedded inside lecture videos (in-video quizzes) to help learners test their understanding of the video. This paper analyzes how users interact with in-video quizzes, and how in-video quizzes influence users' lecture viewing behavior. We analyze the viewing logs of users who took the Machine Learning course on Coursera. Users engage heavily with in-video quizzes - 74% of viewers who start watching a video will attempt its corresponding in-video quiz. We observe spikes in seek activity surrounding in-video quizzes, particularly seeks from the in-video quiz to the preceding section. We show that this is likely due to users reviewing the preceding section to help them answer the quiz, as the majority of users who seek backwards from in-video quizzes have not yet submitted a correct answer, but will later attempt the quiz.

Elice: An online CS Education Platform to Understand How Students Learn Programming,2016,WIP,Work in Progress,"We present Elice1, an online CS (computer science) education platform, and Elivate, a system for taking student learning data from Elice and infers their progress through an educational taxonomy tailored for programming education. Elice captures detailed student learning activities, such as the intermediate revisions of code as students make progress toward completing their programming exercises. With those data, Elivate recognizes each student's progression through an education taxonomy which organizes intermediate stages of learning such that the taxonomy can be used to evaluate student progress as well as to design and improve course materials and structure. With more than 240,000 intermediate source codes generated by 1,000 students, we demonstrate the practicality of the Elice and Elivate.

Expert Evaluation of 300 Projects per Day,2016,WIP,Work in Progress,"In October 2014, one-time MOOC developer Udacity completed its transition from primarily producing massive, open online courses to producing job-focused, project-based microcredentials called ""Nanodegree"" programs. With this transition came a challenge: whereas MOOCs focus on automated assessment and peer-to-peer grading, project-based microcredentials would only be feasible with expert evaluation. With dreams of enrolling tens of thousands of students at a time, the major obstacle became project evaluation. To address this, Udacity developed a system for hiring external experts as project reviewers. A year later, this system has supported project evaluation on a massive scale: 61,000 projects have been evaluated in 12 months, with 50% evaluated within 2.5 hours (and 88% within 24 hours) of submission. More importantly, students rate the feedback they receive very highly at 4.8/5.0.

Explaining Student Behavior at Scale: The Influence of Video Complexity on Student Dwelling Time,2016,Full Paper,Engagement,"Understanding why and how students interact with educational videos is essential to further improve the quality of Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs). In this paper, we look at the complexity of videos to explain two related aspects of student behavior: the dwelling time (how much time students spend watching a video) and the dwelling rate (how much of the video they actually see). Building on a strong tradition of psycholinguistics, we formalize a definition for information complexity in videos. Furthermore, building on recent advancements in time-on-task measures we formalize dwelling time and dwelling rate based on click-stream trace data. The resulting computational model of video complexity explains 22.44% of the variance in the dwelling rate for students that finish watching a paragraph of a video. Video complexity and student dwelling show a polynomial relationship, where both low and high complexity increases dwelling. These results indicate why students spend more time watching (and possibly contemplating about) a video. Furthermore, they show that even fairly straightforward proxies of student behavior such as dwelling can already have multiple interpretations; illustrating the challenge of sense-making from learning analytics.

Exploring the Effects of Lightweight Social Incentives on Learner Performance in MOOCs,2016,WIP,Work in Progress,"We are exploring the effects of social incentives and motivation on learner performance in a massive open online course. In the preliminary study that we report here, we asked learners if they wanted to be considered for a community TAship in a subsequent offering of the course, if they finished in the top 20% of those who completed the current course instance. We prompted students near the beginning of the course and in the middle of the course.

Fuzz Testing Projects in Massive Courses,2016,Full Paper,Automated Assessment,"Scaffolded projects with automated feedback are core instructional components of many massive courses. In subjects that include programming, feedback is typically provided by test cases constructed manually by the instructor. This paper explores the effectiveness of fuzz testing, a randomized technique for verifying the behavior of programs. In particular, we apply fuzz testing to identify when a student's solution differs in behavior from a reference implementation by randomly exploring the space of legal inputs to a program. Fuzz testing serves as a useful complement to manually constructed tests. Instructors can concentrate on designing targeted tests that focus attention on specific issues while using fuzz testing for comprehensive error checking. In the first project of a 1,400-student introductory computer science course, fuzz testing caught errors that were missed by a suite of targeted test cases for more than 48% of students. As a result, the students dedicated substantially more effort to mastering the nuances of the assignment.",,,,,,100,Fuzz testing projects in massive courses,Sridhara S.; Hou B.; Denero J.; Lu J.,"Sridhara, Sumukh (57189385300); Hou, Brian (57210647455); Denero, John (23008419000); Lu, Jeffrey (57189389570)",57189385300; 57210647455; 23008419000; 57189389570,Fuzz testing projects in massive courses,2016.0,L@S 2016 - Proceedings of the 3rd 2016 ACM Conference on Learning at Scale,,,,361,367,6.0,13.0,10.1145/2876034.2876050,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84970005819&doi=10.1145%2f2876034.2876050&partnerID=40&md5=af20820429dd29937939739be886b698,"UC Berkeley, United States","Sridhara S., UC Berkeley, United States; Hou B., UC Berkeley, United States; Denero J., UC Berkeley, United States; Lu J., UC Berkeley, United States",Automated assessment; Behavioral analytics; Online learning,Education; Students; Automated assessment; Automated feedback; Behavioral analytics; Error-checking; Fuzz Testing; Introductory computer science; Online learning; Reference implementation; Software testing,,,,,,,"Basu S., Wu A., Hou B., DeNero J., Problems before solutions: Automated problem clarification at scale, Proceedings of the Second (2015) ACM Conference on Learning@ Scale, pp. 205-213, (2015); Becker S., Abdelnur H., Obes J.L., State R., Festor O., Improving fuzz testing using game theory, Network and System Security (NSS), 2010 4th International Conference on, pp. 263-268, (2010); Bounimova E., Godefroid P., Molnar D., Billions and billions of constraints: Whitebox fuzz testing in production, Proceedings of the 2013 International Conference on Software Engineering, ICSE'13, pp. 122-131, (2013); DeNero J., Klein D., Teaching introductory artificial intelligence with pac-man, Proceedings of the Symposium on Educational Advances in Artificial Intelligence, (2010); Dormann W., Plakosh D., Vulnerability Detection in Activex Controls Through Automated Fuzz Testing, (2008); Edwards S.H., Perez-Quinones M.A., Web-cat: Automatically grading programming assignments, ACM SIGCSE Bulletin, 40, (2008); Forrester J.E., Miller B.P., An empirical study of the robustness of windows nt applications using random testing, Proceedings of the 4th Conference on USENIX Windows Systems Symposium - Volume 4, WSS'00, (2000); Glassman E.L., Singh R., Miller R.C., Feature engineering for clustering student solutions, Proceedings of the First ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale Conference, L@S'14, pp. 171-172, (2014); Godefroid P., Kiezun A., Levin M.Y., Grammar-based whitebox fuzzing, Proceedings of the 29th ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation, PLDI'08, pp. 206-215, (2008); Godefroid P., Levin M.Y., Molnar D.A., Et al., Automated whitebox fuzz testing, NDSS, 8, pp. 151-166, (2008); Hamlet D., Taylor R., Partition testing does not inspire confidence (program testing), IEEE Trans.

Graders as Meta-Reviewers: Simultaneously Scaling and Improving Expert Evaluation for Large Online Classrooms,2016,Full Paper,Flipped Session - Crowdsourcing the Feedback,"Large classes, both online and residential, typically demand many graders for evaluating students' written work. Some classes attempt to use autograding or peer grading, but these both present challenges to assigning grades at for-credit institutions, such as the difficulty of autograding to evaluate free-response answers and the lack of expert oversight in peer grading. In a large, online class at Georgia Tech in Summer 2015, we experimented with a new approach to grading: framing graders as meta-reviewers, charged with evaluating the original work in the context of peer reviews. To evaluate this approach, we conducted a pair of controlled experiments and a handful of qualitative analyses. We found that having access to peer reviews improves the perceived quality of feedback provided by graders without decreasing the graders' efficiency and with only a small influence on the grades assigned.",,,,,,100,Graders as meta-reviewers: Simultaneously scaling and improving expert evaluation for large online classrooms,Joyner D.A.; Ashby W.; Irish L.; Lam Y.; Langston J.; Lupiani I.; Lustig M.; Pettoruto P.; Sheahen D.; Smiley A.; Bruckman A.; Goel A.,"Joyner, David A.

How Mastery Learning Works at Scale,2016,Full Paper,Learner Modelling,"Nearly every adaptive learning system aims to present students with materials personalized to their level of understanding (Enyedy, 2014). Typically, such adaptation follows some form of mastery learning (Bloom, 1968), in which students are asked to master one topic before proceeding to the next topic. Mastery learning programs have a long history of success (Guskey and Gates, 1986; Kulik, Kulik & Bangert-Drowns, 1990) and have been shown to be superior to alternative instructional approaches. Although there is evidence for the effectiveness of mastery learning when it is well supported by teachers, mastery learning's effectiveness is crucially dependent on the ability and willingness of teachers to implement it properly. In particular, school environments impose time constraints and set goals for curriculum coverage that may encourage teachers to deviate from mastery-based instruction. In this paper we examine mastery learning as implemented in Carnegie Learning's Cognitive Tutor. Like in all realworld systems, teachers and students have the ability to violate mastery learning guidance. We investigate patterns associated with violating and following mastery learning over the course of the full school year at the class and student level. We find that violations of mastery learning are associated with poorer student performance, especially among struggling students, and that this result is likely attributable to such violations of mastery learning.",,,,,,100,How mastery learning works at scale,Ritter S.; Yudelson M.; Fancsali S.E.; Berman S.R.,"Ritter, Steve (35732151500); Yudelson, Michael (55920072000); Fancsali, Stephen E.

Identifying Student Misunderstandings using Constructed Responses,2016,WIP,Work in Progress,"In contrast to multiple-choice or selected response questions, constructed response questions can result in a wide variety of incorrect responses. However, constructed responses are richer in information. We propose a technique for using each student's constructed responses in order to identify a subset of their stable conceptual misunderstandings. Our approach is designed for courses with so many students that it is infeasible to interpret every distinct wrong answer manually. Instead, we label only the most frequent wrong answers with the misunderstandings that they indicate, then predict the misunderstandings associated with other wrong answers using statistical co-occurrence patterns. This tiered approach leverages a small amount of human labeling effort to seed an automated procedure that identifies misunderstandings in students. Our approach involves much less effort than inspecting all answers, substantially outperforms a baseline that does not take advantage of co-occurrence statistics, proves robust to different course sizes, and generalizes effectively across student cohorts.",,,,,,100,Identifying student misunderstandings using constructed responses,Stephens-Martinez K.; DeNero J.; Ju A.; Fox A.; Schoen C.,"Stephens-Martinez, Kristin (56144855700); DeNero, John (23008419000); Ju, An (57189384059); Fox, Armando (35571093800); Schoen, Colin (57189379515)",56144855700; 23008419000; 57189384059; 35571093800; 57189379515,Identifying student misunderstandings using constructed responses,2016.0,L@S 2016 - Proceedings of the 3rd 2016 ACM Conference on Learning at Scale,,,,153,156,3.0,1.0,10.1145/2876034.2893395,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84969964560&doi=10.1145%2f2876034.2893395&partnerID=40&md5=6ebeb0bd9569b8dadf77c89c015372e5,"University of California, Berkeley, United States; Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","Stephens-Martinez K., University of California, Berkeley, United States; DeNero J., University of California, Berkeley, United States; Ju A., Tsinghua University, Beijing, China; Fox A., University of California, Berkeley, United States; Schoen C., University of California, Berkeley, United States",Constructed response questions; Education; Introductory computer science; Massive courses; Semi-automatic misunderstanding detection,Education; Education computing; Automated procedures; Co-occurrence pattern; Co-occurrence statistics; Constructed response questions; Introductory computer science; Massive courses; Multiple choice; Semi-automatics; Students,,,,,,,"Basu S., Wu A., Hou B., DeNero J., Problems before solutions: Automated problem clarification at scale, Proceedings of the Second ACM Conference on Learning@ Scale, pp. 205-213, (2015); Holt P., Dubs S., Jones M., Greer J., The state of student modelling, Student Modelling: The Key to Individualized Knowledge-based Instruction, pp. 3-35, (1994); Shute V.J., Focus on formative feedback, Review of Educational Research, pp. 153-189, (2008); Wu T., Chen Y., Han J., Re-examination of interestingness measures in pattern mining: A unified framework, Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, pp. 371-397, (2010)",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","ACM; edX; Google; Instructure, Inc.; Microsoft Research; Oracle Academy","3rd Annual ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2016",25 April 2016 through 26 April 2016,Edinburgh,121394.0,,978-145033726-7,,,English,LS - Proc.

Illusion of Progress is Moar Addictive than Cat Pictures,2016,WIP,Work in Progress,"We conducted two studies on the effect of visual reward mechanisms for increasing engagement with an online learning material. In the first study, we studied the effect of showing cat pictures as a reward to correct and incorrect answers to multiple choice questions, and in the second study, we created an illusion of progress using a progress bar that showed step-wise increments as students answered to the questions.

Improving the Peer Assessment Experience on MOOC Platforms,2016,Full Paper,Flipped Session - Crowdsourcing the Feedback,"Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have revolutionized higher education by offering university-like courses for a large amount of learners via the Internet. The paper at hand takes a closer look on peer assessment as a tool for delivering individualized feedback and engaging assignments to MOOC participants. Benefits, such as scalability for MOOCs and higher order learning, and challenges, such as grading accuracy and rogue reviewers, are described. Common practices and the state-of-the-art to counteract challenges are highlighted. Based on this research, the paper at hand describes a peer assessment workflow and its implementation on the openHPI and openSAP MOOC platforms. This workflow combines the best practices of existing peer assessment tools and introduces some small but crucial improvements.",,,,,,100,Improving the peer assessment experience on MOOC platforms,Staubitz T.; Petrick D.; Bauer M.; Renz J.; Meinel C.,"Staubitz, Thomas (56237871000); Petrick, Dominic (55429749500); Bauer, Matthias (56562339300); Renz, Jan (56236876600); Meinel, Christoph (56187776800)",56237871000; 55429749500; 56562339300; 56236876600; 56187776800,Improving the peer assessment experience on MOOC platforms,2016.0,L@S 2016 - Proceedings of the 3rd 2016 ACM Conference on Learning at Scale,,,,389,398,9.0,52.0,10.1145/2876034.2876043,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84969981786&doi=10.1145%2f2876034.2876043&partnerID=40&md5=d221df3d6b1cc33636b9f054ccb3ade1,"Hasso Plattner Institute, Potsdam, Germany","Staubitz T., Hasso Plattner Institute, Potsdam, Germany; Petrick D., Hasso Plattner Institute, Potsdam, Germany; Bauer M., Hasso Plattner Institute, Potsdam, Germany; Renz J., Hasso Plattner Institute, Potsdam, Germany; Meinel C., Hasso Plattner Institute, Potsdam, Germany",Assessment; MOOC; Online learning; Peer assessment,Grading; Assessment; Common practices; Higher education; Higher-order learning; Massive open online course; MOOC; Online learning; Peer assessment; E-learning,,,,,,,"Baird J.R., Northfield J.R., Learning from the PEEL Experience, (1995); Balfour S.P., Assessing writing in MOOCS: Automated essay scoring and calibrated peer review, Research & Practice in Assessment, pp. 40-48, (2013); Bostock S., Student Peer Assessment, (2000); Boud D., Enhancing Learning Through Self-assessment, (1995); Coursera, Coursera Peer Assessment Student FAQs, (2014); edX, Open Response Assessment Problems, (2014); edX, Open Response Assessments for Students, (2014); Ehrlinger J., Johnson K., Banner M., Dunning D., Kruger J., Why the unskilled are unaware: Further explorations of (absent) self-insight among the incompetent, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 105, 1, pp. 98-121, (2008); Fermelis J., Tucker R., Palmer S., Online self and peer assessment in large, multi-campus, multi-cohort contexts, Providing Choices for Learners and Learning Proceedings ASCILITE Singapore 2007, pp. 271-281, (2007); Edward Gehringer F., Strategies and mechanisms for electronic peer review, Frontiers in Education Conference, 2000.

Learning Student and Content Embeddings for Personalized Lesson Sequence Recommendation,2016,WIP,Work in Progress,"Students in online courses generate large amounts of data that can be used to personalize the learning process and improve quality of education. In this paper, we present the Latent Skill Embedding (LSE), a probabilistic model of students and educational content that can be used to recommend personalized sequences of lessons with the goal of helping students prepare for specific assessments. Akin to collaborative filtering for recommender systems, the algorithm does not require students or content to be described by features, but it learns a representation using access traces. We formulate this problem as a regularized maximum-likelihood embedding of students, lessons, and assessments from historical student-content interactions. Empirical findings on large-scale data from Knewton, an adaptive learning technology company, show that this approach predicts assessment results competitively with benchmark models and is able to discriminate between lesson sequences that lead to mastery and failure.",,,,,,100,Learning Student and content embeddings for personalized lesson sequence recommendation,Reddy S.; Labutov I.; Joachims T.,"Reddy, Siddharth (57189382295); Labutov, Igor (24341027000); Joachims, Thorsten (6602804136)",57189382295; 24341027000; 6602804136,Learning Student and content embeddings for personalized lesson sequence recommendation,2016.0,L@S 2016 - Proceedings of the 3rd 2016 ACM Conference on Learning at Scale,,,,93,96,3.0,11.0,10.1145/2876034.2893375,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84969930800&doi=10.1145%2f2876034.2893375&partnerID=40&md5=b0d8b1361a6486668ee7d3db10d2cb0e,"Dept. of Computer Science, Cornell University, Ithaca, 14850, NY, United States; Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, 14850, NY, United States","Reddy S., Dept. of Computer Science, Cornell University, Ithaca, 14850, NY, United States; Labutov I., Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, 14850, NY, United States; Joachims T., Dept. of Computer Science, Cornell University, Ithaca, 14850, NY, United States",Adaptive learning; Probabilistic embedding; Sequence recommendation,Collaborative filtering; Distributed computer systems; Education; Education computing; Maximum likelihood; Adaptive learning; Educational contents; Empirical findings; Large amounts of data; Probabilistic embedding; Probabilistic modeling; Quality of education; Sequence recommendation; Students,,,,,,,"Latent Skill Embedding; Corbett A.T., Anderson J.R., Knowledge tracing: Modeling the acquisition of procedural knowledge, User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction, 4, 4, pp. 253-278, (1994); Ekanadham C., Karklin Y., T-skirt: Online estimation of student proficiency in an adaptive learning system, Machine Learning for Education Workshop at ICML, (2015); Lan A.S., Studer C., Baraniuk R.G., Time-varying learning and content analytics via sparse factor analysis, Proceedings of the 20th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 452-461, (2014); Linden W., Hambleton R.K., Handbook of Modern Item Response Theory, (1997); Piech C., Bassen J., Huang J., Ganguli S., Sahami M., Guibas L.J., Sohl-Dickstein J., Deep knowledge tracing, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 505-513, (2015); Rasch G., Probabilistic Models for Some Intelligence and Attainment Tests, (1993); Reckase M.D., Multidimensional Item Response Theory, (2009); Rosenbaum P.R., Rubin D.B., The central role of the propensity score in observational studies for causal effects, Biometrika, 70, 1, pp. 41-55, (1983)",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","ACM; edX; Google; Instructure, Inc.; Microsoft Research; Oracle Academy","3rd Annual ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2016",25 April 2016 through 26 April 2016,Edinburgh,121394.0,,978-145033726-7,,,English,LS - Proc.

Learning Transfer: Does It Take Place in MOOCs? An Investigation into the Uptake of Functional Programming in Practice,2016,Full Paper,Flipped Session - Outside the MOOC,"The rising number of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) enable people to advance their knowledge and competencies in a wide range of fields. Learning though is only the first step, the transfer of the taught concepts into practice is equally important and often neglected in the investigation of MOOCs. In this paper, we consider the specific case of FP101x (a functional programming MOOC on edX) and the extent to which learners alter their programming behaviour after having taken the course. We are able to link about one third of all FP101x learners to GitHub, the most popular social coding platform to date and contribute a first exploratory analysis of learner behaviour beyond the MOOC platform. A detailed longitudinal analysis of GitHub log traces reveals that (i) more than 8% of engaged learners transfer, and that (ii) most existing transfer learning findings from the classroom setting are indeed applicable in the MOOC setting as well.

Learning about Teaching in Low-Resource Indian Contexts,2016,WIP,Work in Progress,"Online learning environments are being deployed globally to offer learning opportunities to diverse student communities. We propose the deployment of such an environment in low-resource after-school settings across India. We draw on preliminary research conducted in summer 2015 that leveraged existing ties with an NGO working across 35 after-school classrooms. Our larger goal is to (1) support tutors in curating and distributing learning content to students, (2) engage students in a mobile, networked learning environment where they can share and collaborate, and (3) evaluate the feasibility of online learning environments for low-resource contexts.

Macro Data for Micro Learning: Developing the FUN! Tool for Automated Assessment of Learning,2016,WIP,Work in Progress,"Digital learning environments are becoming more common for students to engage in during and outside of school. With the immense amount of data now available from these environments, researchers need tools to process, manage, and analyze the data. Current methods used by many education researchers are inefficient; however, without data science experience tools used in other professions are not accessible. In this paper, we share about a tool we created called the Functional Understanding Navigator! (FUN! Tool). We have used this tool for different research projects which has allowed us the opportunity to (1) organize our workflow process from start to finish, (2) record log data of all of our analyses, and (3) provide a platform to share our analyses with others through GitHub.

Making the Production of Learning at Scale More Open and Flexible,2016,WIP,Work in Progress,"Professional learning is a critical component of the ongoing improvement, innovation and adoption of new practices that support learning at scale. In this context, educators must learn how to apply digital technologies and work effectively in digital networks. This study examines how higher education professionals adapted their practice to enable more open and flexible work processes. A case study carried out using Activity Theory showed that teams involved in the development of a module all need access to a range of expertise both practical and academic. At each stage, they need to be clear about the learning outcomes of the module, the responsibilities of each team and its constraints.

Mobile Devices for Early Literacy Intervention and Research with Global Reach,2016,Full Paper,Global Village,"Extensive work focuses on the uses of technology at scale for post-literate populations (e.g., MOOC, learning games, Learning Management Systems). Little attention is afforded to non-literate populations, particularly in the developing world. This paper presents an approach using mobile devices with the ultimate goal to reach 770 million people. We developed a novel platform with a cloud backend to deliver educational content to over a thousand marginalized children in different countries: specifically, in remote villages without schools, urban slums with overcrowded schools, and at-risk, rural schools. Here we describe the theoretical basis of our system and results from case studies in three educational contexts. This model will help researchers and designers understand how mobile devices can help children acquire basic skills and aid each other's learning when the benefit of teachers is limited or nonexistent. © 2016 ACM.",,,,,,100,Mobile devices for early literacy intervention and research with global reach,Breazeal C.; Morris R.; Gottwald S.; Galyean T.; Wolf M.,"Breazeal, Cynthia (7003691791); Morris, Robin (35589119600); Gottwald, Stephanie (26537481600); Galyean, Tinsley (6506810010); Wolf, Maryanne (7402497731)",7003691791; 35589119600; 26537481600; 6506810010; 7402497731,Mobile devices for early literacy intervention and research with global reach,2016.0,L@S 2016 - Proceedings of the 3rd 2016 ACM Conference on Learning at Scale,,,,11,20,9.0,11.0,10.1145/2876034.2876046,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84969920054&doi=10.1145%2f2876034.2876046&partnerID=40&md5=4fa3d188083ef6c5c0914ff308e21d5b,"MIT, Cambridge, MA, United States; Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA, United States; Tufts University, Medford, MA, United States; Curious Learning, Cambridge, MA, United States","Breazeal C., MIT, Cambridge, MA, United States; Morris R., Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA, United States; Gottwald S., Tufts University, Medford, MA, United States; Galyean T., Curious Learning, Cambridge, MA, United States; Wolf M., Tufts University, Medford, MA, United States",Early literacy; Global literacy project; Open platform for education; Pre-k learning and technology; Reading brain; Virtual preschool,Developing countries; Education; Mobile devices; Societies and institutions; Teaching; Developing world; Early literacy; Educational contents; Educational context; Global literacy project; Learning management system; Open platforms; Virtual preschool; Engineering education,,,,,,,"Aharony N., Pan W., Ip C., Khayal I., Pentland, Social fMRI: Investigating and shaping social mechanisms in the real world, Pervasive and Mobile Computing, 7, 6, pp. 643-659, (2011); Baron N., Words Onscreen: The Fate of Reading in a Digital World, (2014); Bowman M., Debray S.K., Peterson L.L., Reasoning about naming systems, ACM Trans.

Modeling Student Scheduling Preferences in a Computer-Based Testing Facility,2016,WIP,Work in Progress,"When undergraduate students are allowed to choose a time slot in which to take an exam from a large number of options (e.g., 40), the students exhibit strong preferences among the times. We found that students can be effectively modelled using constrained discrete choice theory to quantify these preferences from their observed behavior. The resulting models are suitable for load balancing when scheduling multiple concurrent exams and for capacity planning given a set schedule.

Observing URL Sharing Behaviour in Massive Online Open Courses,2016,WIP,Work in Progress,"Information sharing is a key activity of Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs) user behavior. Sharing Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) has been identified as a means for individuals in online spaces to generate social relationships, construct knowledge, and disseminate information; however this activity has not been investigated within the MOOC space. This paper presents an observational study of URL sharing within MOOCs, and explores how a MOOC learning community responded to this micro behaviour. The research explored 1,471 comments and 416 learners who displayed URL sharing behavior from two iterations of the 'Irish Lives' Futurelearn/Trinity College, University of Dublin MOOC. The analysis identified patterns of behavior within 'URL Sharers', and suggests that this activity could support greater learner interaction. Although causality is not implied, the results of this analysis contributes a tentative new understanding of URL sharing in MOOCs, and denotes a new MOOC micro behaviour. This can be useful for MOOC practitioners to facilitate design choices.",,,,,,100,Observing URL sharing behaviour in Massive Online Open Courses,Gallagher S.E.; Savage T.,"Gallagher, Silvia Elena (55485342400); Savage, Timothy (35491654500)",55485342400; 35491654500,Observing URL sharing behaviour in Massive Online Open Courses,2016.0,L@S 2016 - Proceedings of the 3rd 2016 ACM Conference on Learning at Scale,,,,129,132,3.0,0.0,10.1145/2876034.2893387,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84969980381&doi=10.1145%2f2876034.2893387&partnerID=40&md5=1fc929f6c04d0eaafbaba1a5d88c035c,"Trinity College, University of Dublin, Ireland","Gallagher S.E., Trinity College, University of Dublin, Ireland; Savage T., Trinity College, University of Dublin, Ireland",Massive Online Open Courses; Online learner behaviour; Uniform Resource Locators,Behavioral research; Information dissemination; Websites; Information sharing; Learner interaction; Learning community; Massive Online Open Courses; Observational study; Online learner behaviour; Social relationships; User behaviors; E-learning,,,,,,,"Ma W.W.K., Yuen A.H.K., Understanding online knowledge sharing: An interpersonal relationship perspective, Computers & Education, 56, 1, pp. 210-219, (2011); Holton A.E., Baek K., Coddington M., Yaschur C., Seeking and sharing: Motivations for linking on twitter, Communication Research Reports, 31, 1, pp. 33-40, (2014); Siemens G., Connectivism: A learning theory for the digital age, International Journal of Instructional Technology & Distance Learning, 2, (2005)",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","ACM; edX; Google; Instructure, Inc.; Microsoft Research; Oracle Academy","3rd Annual ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2016",25 April 2016 through 26 April 2016,Edinburgh,121394.0,,978-145033726-7,,,English,LS - Proc.

Online Urbanism: Interest-based Subcultures as Drivers of Informal Learning in an Online Community,2016,Full Paper,Global Village,"Online communities continue to be an important resource for informal learning. Although many facets of online learning communities have been studied, we have limited understanding of how such communities grow over time to productively engage a large number of learners. In this paper we present a study of a large online community called Scratch which was created to help users learn software programming. We analyzed 5 years of data consisting of 1 million users and their 1.9 million projects. Examination of interactional patterns among highly active members of the community uncovered a markedly temporal dimension to participation. As membership of the Scratch online community grew over time, interest-based subcultures started to emerge. This pattern was uncovered even when clustering was based solely on social network of members. This process, which closely resembles urbanism or the growth of physically populated areas, allowed new members to combine their interests with programming. © 2016 ACM.",,,,,,100,Online urbanism: Interest-based subcultures as drivers of informal learning in an online community,Gelman B.U.; Beckley C.; Johri A.; Domeniconi C.; Yang S.,"Gelman, Ben U.

Optimally Discriminative Choice Sets in Discrete Choice Models: Application to Data-Driven Test Design,2016,WIP,Work in Progress,"Difficult test questions can be made easy by providing a set of possible answer options of which most are obviously wrong. In the education literature, a plethora of instructional guides exist for crafting a suitable set of wrong choices (distractors) in order to probe the students' understanding of the tested concept. The art of multiple-choice question design thus hinges on the question-maker's experience and knowledge of the potential misconceptions. In contrast, we advocate a data-driven approach, where correct and incorrect options are assembled directly from the students' own past submissions. Large-scale online classroom settings, such as massively open online courses (MOOCs), provide an opportunity to design optimal and adaptive multiplechoice questions that are maximally informative about the students' level of understanding of the material.

Optimizing the Amount of Practice in an On-Line Platform,2016,WIP,Work in Progress,"Intelligent tutoring systems are known for providing customized learning opportunities for thousands of users. One feature of many systems is differentiating the amount of practice users receive. To do this, some systems rely on a threshold of consecutive correct responses. For instance, Khan Academy used to use ten correct in a row and now uses five correct in a row as the mastery threshold. The present research uses a series of randomized control trials, conducted in an online learning platform (eg., ASSISTments.org), to explore the effects of different thresholds of consecutive correct responses on learning. Results indicate that despite spending significantly more time practicing there is no significant difference on learning between two, three, four, or five consecutive correct responses. This suggests that systems, and MOOCS, can employ the simple rule of two or three consecutive correct responses when determining the amount of practice provided to users.",,,,,,93,Optimizing the amount of practice in an on-line learning platform,Kelly K.M.; Heffernan N.T.,"Kelly, Kim M.

Peer Grading in a Course on Algorithms and Data Structures: Machine Learning Algorithms do not Improve over Simple Baselines,2016,Full Paper,Automated Assessment,"Peer grading is the process of students reviewing each others' work, such as homework submissions, and has lately become a popular mechanism used in massive open online courses (MOOCs). Intrigued by this idea, we used it in a course on algorithms and data structures at the University of Hamburg. Throughout the whole semester, students repeatedly handed in submissions to exercises, which were then evaluated both by teaching assistants and by a peer grading mechanism, yielding a large dataset of teacher and peer grades. We applied different statistical and machine learning methods to aggregate the peer grades in order to come up with accurate final grades for the submissions (supervised and unsupervised, methods based on numeric scores and ordinal rankings). Surprisingly, none of them improves over the baseline of using the mean peer grade as the final grade. We discuss a number of possible explanations for these results and present a thorough analysis of the generated dataset.",,,,,,100,Peer grading in a course on algorithms and data structures: Machine learning algorithms do not improve over simple baselines,Sajjadi M.S.M.; Alamgir M.; Von Luxburg U.,"Sajjadi, Mehdi S.

Predicting Student Learning using Log Data from Interactive Simulations on Climate Change,2016,WIP,Work in Progress,"Interactive simulations are commonly used tools in technology enhanced education. Simulations can be a powerful tool for allowing students to engage in inquiry, especially in science disciplines. They can help students develop an understanding of complex science phenomena in which multiple variables are at play. Developing models for complex domains, like climate science, is important for learning. Equally important, though, is understanding how students use these simulations. Finding use patterns that lead to learning will allow us to develop better guidance for students who struggle to extract the useful information from the simulation. In this study, we generate features from action log data collected while students interacted with simulations on climate change.

Many studies make use of different classifiers to reach this goal, using the total interaction of the students. In this work we study if it is possible to build more accurate classification models in order to predict the output, analyzing the interaction in an incremental way. We study the data gathered for two years with three kinds of classifying algorithms and we compare the total interaction models with the incremental interaction models.",,,,,,100,Predicting students' performance: Incremental interaction classifiers,Sanchez-Santillan M.; Puerto Paule-Ruiz M.; Cerezo R.; Carlos Nuñez J.,"Sanchez-Santillan, Miguel (56119060800); Puerto Paule-Ruiz, M.

Promoting Student Engagement in MOOCs,2016,WIP,Work in Progress,"MOOCs offer valuable learning experiences to students from all around the world. In addition to providing filmed lectures, readings, and problem sets, many MOOCs allow students to ask and answer questions about course materials with each other through interactive user forums. However, in current MOOCs, only 3 to 5 percent of those students interact in the user forum (Breslow 2013, Rosé et al. 2014) and more than 90 percent of students stop attending the course altogether (Jordan 2014). According to prior studies, this low level of social engagement in MOOCs may lead to student attrition and low performance (Ren et al. 2007). Hence, a natural question that arises then is, how can we promote interaction among students in MOOC discussion forums in order to reduce students' attrition and raise their performance? In this paper, we conduct a field experiment on the edX platform to identify factors that promote student engagement in MOOC discussion forums. Researchers have discovered that the number of people interacting in one online location (e.g. group, community or virtual classroom size) is a key characteristic mediating user engagement (Butler et. al 2014), and most prior works have shown that users in a smaller size group participate more per person. However, contrary to prior research, our results show that the students in larger size cohorts interact more per person and that this greater interaction in turn increases student retention and performance.

Recommending Self-Regulated Learning Strategies Does Not Improve Performance in a MOOC,2016,WIP,Work in Progress,"Many committed learners struggle to achieve their goal of completing a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC). This work investigates self-regulated learning (SRL) in MOOCs and tests if encouraging the use of SRL strategies can improve course performance. We asked 17 highly successful learners about their strategies for how to succeed in a MOOC. Their responses were coded based on a SRL framework and synthesized into seven recommendations. In a randomized experiment, we evaluated the effect of providing the recommendations to learners in the same course (N = 653). Although most learners rated the study tips as very helpful, the intervention did not improve course persistence or achievement. Results suggest that a single SRL prompt at the beginning of the course provides insufficient support. Instead, embedding technological AIDS that adaptively support SRL throughout the course could better support learners in MOOCs.",,,,,,100,Recommending self-regulated learning strategies does not improve performance in a MOOC,Kizilcec R.F.; Pérez-Sanagustín M.; Maldonado J.J.,"Kizilcec, René F.

Structured Knowledge Tracing Models for Student Assessment on Coursera,2016,WIP,Work in Progress,"Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) provide an effective learning platform with various high-quality educational materials accessible to learners from all over the world. However, current MOOCs lack personalized learning guidance and intelligent assessment for individuals. Though a few recent attempts have been made to trace students' knowledge states by adapting the popular Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) model, they have largely ignored the rich structures and correlations among knowledge components (KCs) within a course. This paper proposes to model both the hierarchical and the temporal properties of the knowledge states in order to improve the modeling accuracy. Based on the content organization characteristics on the Coursera MOOC platform, we provide a well-defined KC model, and develop Multi-Grained-BKT and Historical-BKT to capture the above features effectively. Experiments on a Coursera course dataset show our approach significantly improves over previous vanilla BKT models on predicting students' quiz performance.",,,,,,100,Structured knowledge tracing models for student assessment on Coursera,Wang Z.; Zhu J.; Li X.; Hu Z.; Zhang M.,"Wang, Zhuo (56912689500); Zhu, Jile (56597047000); Li, Xiang (58633239800); Hu, Zhiting (56272615700); Zhang, Ming (57193650715)",56912689500; 56597047000; 58633239800; 56272615700; 57193650715,Structured knowledge tracing models for student assessment on Coursera,2016.0,L@S 2016 - Proceedings of the 3rd 2016 ACM Conference on Learning at Scale,,,,209,212,3.0,29.0,10.1145/2876034.2893416,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84970003065&doi=10.1145%2f2876034.2893416&partnerID=40&md5=5d81dabfcfdb833bb10bcf58308a77f9,"School of EECS, Peking University, Beijing, 100871, China; School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, 15213, PA, United States","Wang Z., School of EECS, Peking University, Beijing, 100871, China; Zhu J., School of EECS, Peking University, Beijing, 100871, China; Li X., School of EECS, Peking University, Beijing, 100871, China; Hu Z., School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, 15213, PA, United States; Zhang M., School of EECS, Peking University, Beijing, 100871, China","Hierarchical and temporal; Knowledge tracing, MOOCS, student assessment, student modeling, hierarchical and temporal knowledge tracing; MOOCs; Student assessment; Student modeling",Education; Students; Bayesian knowledge tracings; Educational materials; Hierarchical and temporal; Massive open online course; MOOCs; Personalized learning; Student assessment; Student Modeling; E-learning,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61272343, 61472006); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2014CB340405)",This paper is partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC Grant Numbers 61272343 and 61472006) as well as the National Basic Research Program (973 Program No. 2014CB340405).,"Corbett A.T., Anderson J.R., Knowledge tracing: Modelling the acquisition of procedural knowledge, User Modeling and User-adapted Interaction, 4, 4, pp. 253-278, (1995); Matsuda N., Furukawa T., Bier N., Faloutsos C., Machine beats experts: Automatic discovery of skill models for data-driven online course refinement, Educational Data Mining, pp. 101-108, (2015); Pardos Z., Bergner Y., Seaton D., Pritchard D., Adapting Bayesian knowledge tracing to a massive open online course in edX, Educational Data Mining, pp. 137-144, (2013)",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","ACM; edX; Google; Instructure, Inc.; Microsoft Research; Oracle Academy","3rd Annual ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2016",25 April 2016 through 26 April 2016,Edinburgh,121394.0,,978-145033726-7,,,English,LS - Proc.

Supporting Scalable Data Sharing in Online Education,2016,WIP,Work in Progress,"Online educational tools often generate learning data, and sharing such data between tutors and students can often improve learning outcomes. Unfortunately the process of sharing learning data today is not always transparent to students. Our aim is to improve the transparency and user control aspects of sharing data whilst maintaining the educational utility of data sharing between tutors and students. To do so, we start by surveying the possible methods of sharing data, and we use this to design a token-based scheme for facilitating data sharing. We implemented our scheme and observed it in use by 7,798 students over the course of one year. We find that our proposed scheme provides a good balance between transparency, user control, educational utility and scalability.",,,,,,100,Supporting scalable data sharing in online education,Cummins S.; Beresford A.R.; Davies I.; Rice A.,"Cummins, Stephen (56853273800); Beresford, Alastair R.

TAPS: A MOSS Extension for Detecting Software Plagiarism at Scale,2016,WIP,Work in Progress,"Cheating in computer science classes can damage the reputation of institutions and their students. It is therefore essential to routinely authenticate student submissions with available software plagiarism detection algorithms such as Measure of Software Similarity (MOSS). Scaling this task for large classes where assignments are repeated each semester adds complexity and increases the instructor workload. The MOSS Tool for Addressing Plagiarism at Scale (MOSS-TAPS), organizes the MOSS submission task in courses that repeat coding assignments. In a recent use-case in the Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) program at the Georgia Institute of Technology, the instructor time spent was reduced from 50 hours to only 10 minutes using the managed submission tool design presented here.

The Civic Mission of MOOCs: Measuring Engagement across Political Differences in Forums,2016,Full Paper,Global Village,"In this study, we develop methods for computationally measuring the degree to which students engage in MOOC forums with other students holding different political beliefs. We examine a case study of a single MOOC about education policy, Saving Schools, where we obtain measures of student education policy preferences that correlate with political ideology. Contrary to assertions that online spaces often become echo chambers or ideological silos, we find that students in this case hold diverse political beliefs, participate equitably in forum discussions, directly engage (through replies and upvotes) with students holding opposing beliefs, and converge on a shared language rather than talking past one another. Research that focuses on the civic mission of MOOCs helps ensure that open online learning engages the same breadth of purposes that higher education aspires to serve.",,,,,,100,The civic mission of MOOCs: Measuring engagement across political differences in forums,Reich J.; Stewart B.; Mavon K.; Tingley D.,"Reich, Justin (56144824600); Stewart, Brandon (55802499900); Mavon, Kimia (57189383671); Tingley, Dustin (12446550300)",56144824600; 55802499900; 57189383671; 12446550300,The civic mission of MOOCs: Measuring engagement across political differences in forums,2016.0,L@S 2016 - Proceedings of the 3rd 2016 ACM Conference on Learning at Scale,,,,1,10,9.0,19.0,10.1145/2876034.2876045,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84969932175&doi=10.1145%2f2876034.2876045&partnerID=40&md5=62bfb7e272bc458803d5e817f980b08c,"MIT, Cambridge, MA, United States; Princeton, NJ, United States; Harvard, Cambridge, MA, United States","Reich J., MIT, Cambridge, MA, United States; Stewart B., Princeton, NJ, United States; Mavon K., Harvard, Cambridge, MA, United States; Tingley D., Harvard, Cambridge, MA, United States",Civic education; Discourse; MOOCs; Political ideology; Structural topic model; Text analysis,Education; Education computing; Social sciences; Discourse; MOOCs; Political ideologies; Text analysis; Topic Modeling; Students,,,,,,,"Bischof J.M., Airoldi E.M., Summarizing topical content with word frequency and exclusivity, International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), pp. 201-208, (2012); Blei D.M., Ng A.Y., Jordan M.I., Latent dirichlet allocation, The Journal of Machine Learning Research, 3, pp. 993-1022, (2003); Chafkin M., Udacity's Sebastian Thrun, Godfather of Free Online Education, Changes Course, (2014); Education Next, Results from the 2015 Education Next Poll, (2015); Dean Ho A., Chuang I., Reich J., Austun Coleman C., Whitehill J., Northcutt C.G., Jay Williams J., Hansen J.D., Lopez G., Petersen R., HarvardX and MITx: Two Years of Open Online Courses Fall 2012-Summer 2014, (2015); Gardner H., Davis K., The App Generation: How Today's Youth Navigate Identity, Intimacy, and Imagination in a Digital World, (2013); Kahne J., Middaugh E., Lee N., Feezell J.T., Youth online activity and exposure to diverse perspectives, New Media & Society, 14, 3, pp. 492-512, (2012); Orfield G., Kucsera J., Siegel-Hawley G., E Pluribus...

The Distributed Esteemed Endorser Review: A Novel Approach to Participant Assessment in MOOCs,2016,WIP,Work in Progress,"One of the most challenging aspects of developing a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) is designing an accurate method to effectively assess participant knowledge and skills. The Distributed Esteemed Endorser Review (DEER) approach has been developed as an alternative for those MOOCs where traditional approaches to assessment are not appropriate. In DEER, course projects are certified in-person by an ""Esteemed Endorser"", an individual who is typically senior in rank to the student, but is not necessarily an expert in the course content. Not only does DEER provide a means to certify that course goals have been met, it also provides MOOC participants with the opportunity to share information about what they have learned with others at the local level.",,,,,,100,The Distributed Esteemed Endorser Review: A novel approach to participant assessment in MOOCs,Kay J.S.; Nolan T.J.; Grello T.M.,"Kay, Jennifer S.

The Opportunity Count Model: A Flexible Approach to Modeling Student Performance,2016,WIP,Work in Progress,"Detailed performance data can be exploited to achieve stronger student models when predicting next problem correctness (NPC) within intelligent tutoring systems. However, the availability and importance of these details may differ significantly when considering opportunity count (OC), or the compounded sequence of problems a student experiences within a skill. Inspired by this intuition, the present study introduces the Opportunity Count Model (OCM), a unique approach to student modeling in which separate models are built for differing OCs rather than creating a blanket model that encompasses all OCs. We use Random Forest (RF), which can be used to indicate feature importance, to construct the OCM by considering detailed performance data within tutor log files.

The Role of Social Media in MOOCs: How to Use Social Media to Enhance Student Retention,2016,Full Paper,Flipped Session - Outside the MOOC,"The Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) have experienced rapid development. However, high dropout rate has become a salient issue. Many studies have attempted to understand this phenomenon; other have explored mechanisms for enhancing retention. For instance, social media has been used to improve student engagement and retention. However there is a lack of (1) empirical studies of social media use and engagement compared to embedded MOOC forums; and (2) rationales for social media use from both instructors' and students' perspectives. We addressed these open issues through the collection and analysis of real usage data from three MOOC forums and their associated social media (i.e., Facebook) groups as well as conducting interviews of instructors and students. We found that students show higher engagement and retention in social media than in MOOC forums, and identified both instructors' and students' perspectives that lead to the results. We discuss design implications for future MOOC platforms. © 2016 ACM.

The Unexpected Pedagogical Benefits of Making Higher Education Accessible,2016,WIP,Work in Progress,"Many ongoing efforts in online education aim to increase accessibility through affordability and flexibility, but some critics have noted that pedagogy often suffers during these efforts. In contrast, in the low-cost for-credit Georgia Tech Online Masters of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) program, we have observed that the features that make the program accessible also lead to pedagogical benefits.

Understanding ESL Students' Motivations to Increase MOOC Accessibility,2016,WIP,Work in Progress,"Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have the potential to bridge education and literacy gaps by offering high quality, free courses to anyone with an Internet connection. MOOCs in their present state, however, may be relatively inaccessible to non-native English speakers, as a majority of MOOC content is in the English language. While a potential solution is to translate all MOOC content into all languages, it is not known whether this solution will satisfy the learning goals of all English as a Second Language (ESL) speakers. Through a series of interviews, we investigate ESL speakers' motivations for taking MOOCs and other online courses. Our findings show that ESL speakers have a variety of motivations for taking online courses that are not captured in current surveys, which implies that current one-size-fits-all approaches to increasing MOOC accessibility for learners with a first language other than English may not be effective. Rather, offering learners individualized tools based on their motivation and needs may be more effective.",,,,,,100,Understanding ESL students' motivations to increase MOOC accessibility,Uchidiuno J.; Ogan A.; Yarzebinski E.; Hammer J.,"Uchidiuno, Judith (57189377714); Ogan, Amy (22433477900); Yarzebinski, Evelyn (40662162300); Hammer, Jessica (56597500700)",57189377714; 22433477900; 40662162300; 56597500700,Understanding ESL students' motivations to increase MOOC accessibility,2016.0,L@S 2016 - Proceedings of the 3rd 2016 ACM Conference on Learning at Scale,,,,169,172,3.0,14.0,10.1145/2876034.2893398,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84969931858&doi=10.1145%2f2876034.2893398&partnerID=40&md5=a642cea9817af612402bc6a5e1ff1a50,"HCI Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, 15213, PA, United States","Uchidiuno J., HCI Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, 15213, PA, United States; Ogan A., HCI Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, 15213, PA, United States; Yarzebinski E., HCI Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, 15213, PA, United States; Hammer J., HCI Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, 15213, PA, United States",English as a Second Language; Learning motivations; MOOC accessibility; MOOCs,Computational linguistics; Education; Internet; Motivation; Transportation; English as a second language; English as a second languages (ESL); English languages; Internet connection; Learning motivation; Massive open online course; MOOC accessibility; MOOCs; E-learning,,,,,,,"Liyanagunawardena T.R., Adams A.A., Williams S.A., MOOCs: A systematic study of the published literature 2008-2012, The International Review of Research in Open and Distributed Learning, 14, 3, pp. 202-227, (2013); Nyoni J., The viral nature of massive open online courses (MOOCs) in open and distance learning: Discourses of quality, mediation and control, Mediterranean Journal of Social Sciences, 4, 3, (2013); Yeager C., Hurley-Dasgupta B., Bliss C.A., Cmoocs and global learning: An authentic alternative, Journal of Asynchronous Learning Networks, 17, 2, pp. 133-147, (2013); English-speaking world, Wikipedia, the Free Encyclopedia, (2015); Find MOOCs By Languages, MOOC List; A New Partnership to Bring Coursera to the Hundreds of Millions of Chinese Learners Across the World",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","ACM; edX; Google; Instructure, Inc.; Microsoft Research; Oracle Academy","3rd Annual ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2016",25 April 2016 through 26 April 2016,Edinburgh,121394.0,,978-145033726-7,,,English,LS - Proc.

Using Multiple Accounts for Harvesting Solutions in MOOCs,2016,Full Paper,Learner Modelling,"The study presented in this paper deals with copying answers in MOOCs. Our findings show that a significant fraction of the certificate earners in the course that we studied have used what we call harvesting accounts to find correct answers that they later submitted in their main account, the account for which they earned a certificate. In total, ∼ 2.5% of the users who earned a certificate in the course obtained the majority of their points by using this method, and ∼10% of them used it to some extent. This paper has two main goals. The first is to define the phenomenon and demonstrate its severity. The second is characterizing key factors within the course that affect it, and suggesting possible remedies that are likely to decrease the amount of cheating. The immediate implication of this study is to MOOCs.

Work in Progress: Student Behaviors Using Feedback in a Blended Physics Undergraduate Classroom,2016,WIP,Work in Progress,"Two major benefits of Massive Open Online Course platforms are their collection of fine grain data on student interactions with the course website and their capacity to give students immediate feedback on their work. We study the patterns of students' usage of immediate feedback in an undergraduate physics course that uses blended learning, and we present informative aggre-gate descriptives from this 474-student class. We find that overall student study strategies mirror those in ""traditional"" courses, that students strategically use the auto-checking feature of the platform, and that they extensively use the other content resources available to them on the platform. Several of these findings support educational research that has not had the benefit of the data MOOC platforms give us access to.

A Memory-Augmented Neural Model for Automated Grading,2017,WIP,Work in Progress,"The need for automated grading tools for essay writing and open-ended assignments has received increasing attention due to the unprecedented scale of Massive Online Courses (MOOCs) and the fact that more and more students are relying on computers to complete and submit their school work. In this paper, we propose an efficient memory networks-powered automated grading model. The idea of our model stems from the philosophy that with enough graded samples for each score in the rubric, such samples can be used to grade future work that is found to be similar. For each possible score in the rubric, a student response graded with the same score is collected. These selected responses represent the grading criteria specified in the rubric and are stored in the memory component. Our model learns to predict a score for an ungraded response by computing the relevance between the ungraded response and each selected response in memory. The evaluation was conducted on the Kaggle Automated Student Assessment Prize (ASAP) dataset. The results show that our model achieves state-of-The-Art performance in 7 out of 8 essay sets. © 2017 ACM.",,,,,,100,A memory-Augmented neural model for automated grading,Zhao S.; Zhang Y.; Xiong X.; Botelho A.; Heffernan N.,"Zhao, Siyuan (57194028898); Zhang, Yaqiong (57194041435); Xiong, Xiaolu (57199839343); Botelho, Anthony (56597707600); Heffernan, Neil (14041775100)",57194028898; 57194041435; 57199839343; 56597707600; 14041775100,A memory-Augmented neural model for automated grading,2017.0,L@S 2017 - Proceedings of the 4th (2017) ACM Conference on Learning at Scale,,,,189,192,3.0,43.0,10.1145/3051457.3053982,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018431172&doi=10.1145%2f3051457.3053982&partnerID=40&md5=baa3a30dca894557e2a0996e4deb1e90,"Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, 01609, MA, United States","Zhao S., Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, 01609, MA, United States; Zhang Y., Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, 01609, MA, United States; Xiong X., Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, 01609, MA, United States; Botelho A., Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, 01609, MA, United States; Heffernan N., Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, 01609, MA, United States",Automated grading; Memory networks; Natural language processing; Neural networks; Word embeddings,Automation; Natural language processing systems; Neural networks; Students; Automated grading; Embeddings; Grading criteria; Memory component; Memory network; NAtural language processing; State-of-the-art performance; Student assessment; Grading,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF, (1724889, ACI- 1440753, DRL-1031398, DRL-1109483, DRL-1252297, DRL-1316736); Office of Naval Research, ONR; U.S. Department of Education, ED; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, BMGF; Institute of Education Sciences, IES, (R305A120125, R305C100024)","We acknowledge funding from multiple NSF grants (ACI- 1440753, DRL-1252297, DRL-1109483, DRL-1316736 & DRL-1031398), the U.S. Department of Education (IES R305A120125 & R305C100024 and GAANN), the ONR, and the Gates Foundation.","Chen H., He B., Automated Essay Scoring by Maximizing Human-Machine Agreement., (2013); Pennington J., Socher R., Manning C.D., Glove: Global Vectors for Word Representation, 14, pp. 1532-1543, (2014); Phandi P., Chai K.M.A., Ng H.T., Flexible Domain Adaptation for Automated Essay Scoring Using Correlated Linear Regression, (2015); Sukhbaatar S., Szlam A., Weston J., Fergus R., End-To-end memory networks, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 2440-2448, (2015); Taghipour K., Ng H.T., A Neural Approach to Automated Essay Scoring, (2016); Weston J., Chopra S., Bordes A., Memory Networks, (2014)",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",Assoc. for Computing Machinery (ACM),"4th Annual ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2017",20 April 2017 through 21 April 2017,Cambridge,127333.0,,978-145034450-0,,,English,L@S - Proc.

A Novel Self-Paced Model for Teaching Programming,2017,WIP,Work in Progress,"The Self-Paced Learning Increases Retention and Capacity (SPARC) project is responding to the well-documented surge in CS enrollment by creating a self-paced learning environment that blends online learning, automated assessment, collaborative practice, and peer-supported learning. SPARC delivers educational material online, encourages students to practice programming in groups, frees them to learn material at their own pace, and allows them to demonstrate proficiency at any time. This model contrasts with traditional course offerings, which impose a single schedule of due dates and exams for all students. SPARC allows students to complete courses faster or slower at a pace tailored to the individual, thereby allowing universities to teach more students with the same or fewer resources. This paper describes the goals and elements of the SPARC model as applied to CS1.

A Probabilistic Approach for Discovering Difficult Course Topics Using Clickstream Data,2017,WIP,Work in Progress,"One of the main factors affecting the success and effectiveness of Massive Open Online Courses is the ability of the instructor to acquire and incorporate student feedback in a timely manner, and preferably before assigning grades to student assessments. This research uses raw clickstream data from video watching sessions of the Coursera MOOC: ""Text Retrieval and Search Engines""1 to discover which topics are difficult for the students. We introduce a measure for topic difficulty based on these clickstream events, and rank the topics according to this measure. The validity of our ranking is evaluated by comparing it with the ranking of topics based on student votes and find that our method agrees with the ranking based on student votes with > 63% accuracy. © 2017 ACM.",,,,,,100,A probabilistic approach for discovering difficult course topics using clickstream data,Boughoula A.; Geigle C.; Zhai C.X.,"Boughoula, Assma (57194033401); Geigle, Chase (55637377400); Zhai, Cheng Xiang (35232046000)",57194033401; 55637377400; 35232046000,A probabilistic approach for discovering difficult course topics using clickstream data,2017.0,L@S 2017 - Proceedings of the 4th (2017) ACM Conference on Learning at Scale,,,,303,306,3.0,2.0,10.1145/3051457.3054010,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018421564&doi=10.1145%2f3051457.3054010&partnerID=40&md5=d7614fcd11801363355184e6f945d536,"201 N Goodwin Ave, Urbana, 61801, IL, United States","Boughoula A., 201 N Goodwin Ave, Urbana, 61801, IL, United States; Geigle C., 201 N Goodwin Ave, Urbana, 61801, IL, United States; Zhai C.X., 201 N Goodwin Ave, Urbana, 61801, IL, United States",Probabilistic clustering; Student feedback; Topic difficulty,Students; Clickstream data; Massive open online course; Probabilistic approaches; Probabilistic clustering; Student assessment; Student feedback; Text retrieval; Topic difficulty; Search engines,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF, (1629161, DGE-1144245)",We thank Dr. Maryalice Wu for granting us access to the MOOC data.

A Statistical Framework for Predictive Model Evaluation in MOOCs,2017,WIP,Work in Progress,"Feature extraction and model selection are two essential processes when building predictive models of student success. In this work we describe and demonstrate a statistical approach to both tasks, comparing five modeling techniques (a lasso penalized logistic regression model, naïve Bayes, random forest, SVM, and classification tree) across three sets of features (week-only, summed, and appended, from [7]). We conduct this comparison on a dataset compiled from 30 total offerings of five different MOOCs run on the Coursera platform. Through the use of the Friedman test with a corresponding post-hoc Nemenyi test, we present comparative performance results for several classifiers across the three different feature extraction methods, demonstrating a rigorous inferential process intended to guide future analyses of student success systems. © 2017 ACM.",,,,,,100,A statistical framework for predictive model evaluation in MOOCs,Gardner J.; Brooks C.,"Gardner, Josh (57193776363); Brooks, Christopher (14047887300)",57193776363; 14047887300,A statistical framework for predictive model evaluation in MOOCs,2017.0,L@S 2017 - Proceedings of the 4th (2017) ACM Conference on Learning at Scale,,,,269,272,3.0,5.0,10.1145/3051457.3054002,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018445084&doi=10.1145%2f3051457.3054002&partnerID=40&md5=5affb8b1ced83a8c0dc055aae89fd66f,"School of Information, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 48109, MI, United States","Gardner J., School of Information, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 48109, MI, United States; Brooks C., School of Information, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 48109, MI, United States",Evaluation; Machine learning; MOOC; Predictive modeling,Decision trees; Extraction; Feature extraction; Regression analysis; Comparative performance; Evaluation; Feature extraction methods; MOOC; Penalized logistic regression; Predictive modeling; Statistical approach; Statistical framework; Learning systems,,,,,,,"Demsar J., Statistical comparisons of classifiers over multiple Data Sets, J.

A Visual Approach towards Knowledge Engineering and Understanding How Students Learn in Complex Environments,2017,Full Paper,Engineering Learning Environments,"Exploratory learning environments, such as virtual labs, support divergent learning pathways. However, due to their complexity, building computational models of learning is challenging as it is difficult to identify features that (i) are informative with respect to common learning strategies, (ii) abstract similar actions beyond surface differences, and (iii) differentiate groups of learners. In this paper, we present a visualization tool that addresses these challenges by facilitating a novel analytic approach to aid in the knowledge engineering process, focusing on five main capabilities: data-driven hypotheses raising, visualizing behavior over time, easily grouping related actions, contrasting learners' behaviors on these actions, and comparing the behaviors of groups of learners. We apply this analytic approach to better understand how students work with a popular interactive physics virtual lab. By splitting learners by learning gains, we found that productive learners performed more active testing and adapted more quickly to the task at hand by focusing on more relevant testing instruments. Implications for online virtual labs and a broader class of complex learning environments are discussed throughout. © 2017 ACM.",,,,,,100,A visual approach towards knowledge engineering and understanding how students learn in complex environments,Fratamico L.; Perez S.; Roll I.,"Fratamico, Lauren (56024878700); Perez, Sarah (57194037853); Roll, Ido (8987398200)",56024878700; 57194037853; 8987398200,A visual approach towards knowledge engineering and understanding how students learn in complex environments,2017.0,L@S 2017 - Proceedings of the 4th (2017) ACM Conference on Learning at Scale,,,,13,22,9.0,3.0,10.1145/3051457.3051468,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018428477&doi=10.1145%2f3051457.3051468&partnerID=40&md5=8b1cd1dbd7ff2b67e29aeed43a7356e6,"University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada","Fratamico L., University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada; Perez S., University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada; Roll I., University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada",H.5.3.

Applying and Exploring Bayesian Hypothesis Testing for Large Scale Experimentation in Online Tutoring Systems,2017,WIP,Work in Progress,"This paper demonstrates the viability of using Bayesian hypothesis testing for statistical analysis of experiments run in online learning systems. An empirical Bayesian method for learning a genuine prior from past historical experiment data is applied to a dataset consisting of twenty-Two randomized controlled A/B experiments collected from the ASSISTments online learning platform. We show that using only twenty-Two experiments results in a learned genuine prior with poor confidence interval estimates, and that roughly 200 experiments are required for a reasonable estimate of the true probability of an experiment having differences between experiment groups. We also conducted a leave-one-experiment-out cross-validation experiment, where a genuine prior is learned from twenty-one of the randomized controlled experiments provided in the dataset and then used to evaluate the remaining experiment. From this experiment we show that Bayesian hypothesis testing performs similar to Frequentist hypothesis testing and both methods were in agreement. © 2017 ACM.",,,,,,100,Applying and exploring Bayesian hypothesis testing for large scale experimentation in online tutoring systems,Dommeti V.; Selent D.,"Dommeti, Vijaya (57195643963); Selent, Douglas (56335563500)",57195643963; 56335563500,Applying and exploring Bayesian hypothesis testing for large scale experimentation in online tutoring systems,2017.0,L@S 2017 - Proceedings of the 4th (2017) ACM Conference on Learning at Scale,,,,229,232,3.0,0.0,10.1145/3051457.3053992,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018380983&doi=10.1145%2f3051457.3053992&partnerID=40&md5=08b2fe9518894555848ca38acefc7971,"Rivier University, Nashua, 03060, NH, United States","Dommeti V., Rivier University, Nashua, 03060, NH, United States; Selent D., Rivier University, Nashua, 03060, NH, United States",ASSISTments; Bayesian hypothesis testing; Large scale experimentation; Randomized controlled trials,Bayesian networks; E-learning; Online systems; ASSISTments; Bayesian hypothesis; Confidence interval; Controlled experiment; Empirical Bayesian method; Large-scale experimentations; On-line learning systems; Randomized controlled trial; Statistical tests,,,,,,,"Basford K.E., Greenway D.R., McLachlan G.J., Peel D., Standard errors of fitted component means of normal mixtures, Computational Statistics, 12, 1, pp. 1-18, (1997); Bloom B.S., The 2 sigma problem: The search for methods of group instruction as effective as one-To-one tutoring, Educational Researcher, 13, 6, pp. 4-16, (1984); Deng A., Lu J., Chen S., Continuous Monitoring of A/B Tests without Pain: Optional Stopping in Bayesian Testing, (2016); Deng A., Objective Bayesian two sample hypothesis testing for online controlled experiments, Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on World Wide Web, pp. 923-928, (2015); Efron B., A 250-year argument: Belief, behavior, and the bootstrap, Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society, 50, 1, pp. 129-146, (2013); Kass R.E., Raftery A.E., Bayes factors, Journal of the American Statistical Association, 90, 430, pp. 773-795, (1995); Kohavi R., Deng A., Frasca B., Walker T., Xu Y., Pohlmann N., Online controlled experiments at large scale, Proceedings of the 19th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 1168-1176, (2013); Ioannidis J.P.A., Contradicted and initially stronger effects in highly cited clinical research, JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association, 294, 2, pp. 218-228, (2005); Ioannidis J.P.A., Why most published research findings are false, Plos Med, 2, 8, (2005); Rosenthal R., The file drawer problem and tolerance for null results, Psychological Bulletin, 86, 3, (1979); Selent D., Patikorn T., Heffernan N., ASSISTments dataset from multiple randomized controlled experiments, Proceedings of the Third (2016) ACM Conference on Learning@ Scale, pp. 181-184, (2016); Xiong X., Li S., Beck J.E., Will you get it right next week: Predict delayed performance in enhanced its mastery cycle, FLAIRS Conference, (2013)",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",Assoc. for Computing Machinery (ACM),"4th Annual ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2017",20 April 2017 through 21 April 2017,Cambridge,127333.0,,978-145034450-0,,,English,L@S - Proc.

Authentic Science Inquiry Learning at Scale Enabled by an Interactive Biology Cloud Experimentation Lab,2017,WIP,Work in Progress,"National guidelines advocate for a more sophisticated STEM education that integrates complex and authentic scientific practices, e.g., experimentation, data collection, data analysis, and modeling. How to achieve that is currently unclear for both presential and distance education. We recently developed a scalable cloud lab that enables many online users to perform phototaxis experiment with real, living Euglena cells (opposed to just simulations). Here we iteratively designed and deployed an open course on the edX platform including suitable user interfaces that facilitates inquiry-based learning on this cloud lab: Online students (>300) run real experiments (>2,300), performed data analysis, explored models, and even formulated and experimentally tested their own hypotheses. Platform and course content are now suited for global adaptation in formal K-16 education.

CROWDLEARNING: Towards Collaborative Problem-Posing at Scale,2017,WIP,Work in Progress,"This paper presents a new pedagogical paradigm ""Crowdlearning"", where students experience deeper learning through collaboratively creating learning materials for each other. Crowdlearning practice is envisioned to produce large ""banks"" of subject matter problems generated by students themselves, in a crowdsourced way, as the students learn new subjects; these problems can then serve as learning and assessment materials usable at scale. This paper overviews the motivation for the development of Crowdlearning as a teaching practice and the theoretical drivers behind it. The paper then reports on preliminary field studies and experiences suggesting that Crowdlearning has a solid potential for adoption in STEM. © 2017 ACM.",,,,,,100,CROWDLEARNING: Towards collaborative problem-posing at scale,Farasat A.; Nikolaev A.; Miller S.; Gopalsamy R.,"Farasat, Alireza (34167643600); Nikolaev, Alexander (24076936000); Miller, Suzanne (26640538400); Gopalsamy, Rahul (57194037151)",34167643600; 24076936000; 26640538400; 57194037151,CROWDLEARNING: Towards collaborative problem-posing at scale,2017.0,L@S 2017 - Proceedings of the 4th (2017) ACM Conference on Learning at Scale,,,,221,224,3.0,20.0,10.1145/3051457.3053990,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018381506&doi=10.1145%2f3051457.3053990&partnerID=40&md5=d033e688027e0d493c88e5ff115c19a3,"Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, University at Buffalo, United States; Graduate School of Education, University at Buffalo, United States","Farasat A., Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, University at Buffalo, United States; Nikolaev A., Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, University at Buffalo, United States; Miller S., Graduate School of Education, University at Buffalo, United States; Gopalsamy R., Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, University at Buffalo, United States",Collaborative learning; Crowdlearning; Intelligent tutoring systems; Learning technologies; Massive open online courses; Problem posing,Computer aided instruction; Online systems; Students; Teaching; Collaborative learning; Crowdlearning; Intelligent tutoring system; Learning technology; Massive open online course; Problem posing; Education,,,,,,,"Beal C.R., Cohen P.R., Teach ourselves: Technology to support problem posing in the STEM classroom, Creative Education, 3, 4, (2012); Braha D., Maimon O., The design process: Properties, paradigms, and structure, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics-Part A: Systems and Humans, 27, 2, pp. 146-166, (1997); Bransford J.D., Brown A.L., Cocking R.R., How People Learn: Brain, Mind, Experience, and School, (1999); DiSessa A.A., Students' criteria for representational adequacy, Symbolizing, Modeling and Tool Use in Mathematics Education, pp. 105-129, (2002); Frager S., Stern C., Learning by teaching, The Reading Teacher, 23, 5, pp. 403-417, (1970); Hoadley C.M., Kilner P.G., Using technology to transform communities of practice into knowledge-building communities, ACM SIGGROUP Bulletin, 25, 1, pp. 31-40, (2005); Hogan D.M., Tudge J.R.H., Implications of Vygotsky's Theory for Peer Learning, (1999); Koedinger K.R., Kim J., Jia J.Z., McLaughlin E.A., Bier N.L., Learning is not a spectator sport: Doing is better than watching for learning from a MOOC, Proceedings of the Second (2015) ACM Conference on Learning@ Scale, pp. 111-120, (2015); Li M.-C., Tsai C.-C., Game-based learning in science education: A review of relevant research, Journal of Science Education and Technology, 22, 6, pp. 877-898, (2013); Linn M.C., Clark D., Slotta J.D., WISE design for knowledge integration, Science Education, 87, 4, pp. 517-538, (2003); Matsuda N., Yarzebinski E., Keiser V., Raizada R., Stylianides G.J., Koedinger K.R., Studying the effect of a competitive game show in a learning by teaching environment, International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 23, 1-4, pp. 1-21, (2013); Mishra S., Iyer S., An exploration of problem posing-based activities as an assessment tool and as an instructional strategy, Research and Practice in Technology Enhanced Learning, 10, 1, (2015); Mitros P., Learnersourcing of complex assessments, Proceedings of the Second (2015) ACM Conference on Learning@ Scale, pp. 317-320, (2015); Palmero J.R., Rodriguez J.S., Peer assessment in higher education, New Educational Review, 27, 1, pp. 247-255, (2012); Zundert M.V., Sluijsmans D., Merrienboer J.V., Effective peer assessment processes: Research findings and future directions, Learning and Instruction, 20, 4, pp. 270-279, (2010); Williams J.J., Kim J., Rafferty A., Maldonado S., Gajos K.Z., Lasecki W.S., Heffernan N., AXIS: Generating explanations at scale with learner sourcing and machine learning, Proceedings of the Third (2016) ACM Conference on Learning@ Scale, pp. 379-388, (2016); Yudelson M.V., Koedinger K.R., Gordon G.J., Individualized Bayesian knowledge tracing models, International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education, pp. 171-180, (2013)",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",Assoc. for Computing Machinery (ACM),"4th Annual ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2017",20 April 2017 through 21 April 2017,Cambridge,127333.0,,978-145034450-0,,,English,L@S - Proc.

Characterizing ELL Students' Behavior During MOOC Videos Using Content Type,2017,WIP,Work in Progress,"Making MOOCs accessible to English Language Learners (ELLs) requires that students understand the language of instruction, and that instructional strategies address their unique learning challenges. Through the analysis of clickstream log data gathered from two MOOC courses deployed on Coursera, Introduction to Psychology and Statistical Thermodynamics, we show that ELL students exhibit distinct struggle behaviors in video portions without visual AIDS e.g., narrations without slides. Our findings challenge widely accepted multimedia design principles such as the split attention effect, provide insights into designing MOOC videos, and emphasize the need for adaptivity to increase MOOC access for ELLs. © 2017 ACM.",,,,,,100,Characterizing ELL students' behavior during mooc videos using content type,Uchidiuno J.; Hammer J.; Yarzebinski E.; Koedinger K.R.; Ogan A.,"Uchidiuno, Judith (57189377714); Hammer, Jessica (56597500700); Yarzebinski, Evelyn (40662162300); Koedinger, Kenneth R.

Collaboration and Teamwork on a MOOC Platform: A Toolset,2017,WIP,Work in Progress,"Teamwork is an an important topic in education. It fosters deep learning and allows educators to assign interesting tasks, which would be too complex to be solved by single participants due to the time restrictions defined by the context of a course. Furthermore, today's jobs require an increasing amount of team skills. On the other hand, teamwork comes with a variety of issues of its own. Particularly in large scale settings, such as MOOCs, teamwork is challenging. Courses often end with dysfunctional teams due to drop-outs or insufficient matching. The paper at hand presents a set of three tools that we have recently added to our system to enable teamwork in our courses. The presented tools are evaluated in terms of success rates of the created teams and workload reduction for the courses' teaching teams. © 2017 ACM.",,,,,,99,Collaboration and teamwork on a MOOC platform a toolset,Staubitz T.; Meinel C.,"Staubitz, Thomas (56237871000); Meinel, Christoph (56187776800)",56237871000; 56187776800,Collaboration and teamwork on a MOOC platform a toolset,2017.0,L@S 2017 - Proceedings of the 4th (2017) ACM Conference on Learning at Scale,,,,165,168,3.0,18.0,10.1145/3051457.3053975,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018393236&doi=10.1145%2f3051457.3053975&partnerID=40&md5=479dbbf40cb2af705a48ddac03fb26c6,"Hasso Plattner Institute, University of Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany","Staubitz T., Hasso Plattner Institute, University of Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany; Meinel C., Hasso Plattner Institute, University of Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany",Collaboration; Massive open online courses; MOOC; Peerassessment; Teamwork,Education; Collaboration; Massive open online course; MOOC; Peer assessment; Teamwork; Teaching,,,,,,,"How Can I Assess Group Work, (2008); Staubitz T., Petrick D., Bauer M., Renz J., Meinel C., Improving the peer assessment experience on MOOC platforms, Proceedings of the Third (2016) ACM Conference on Learning Scale (LS '16), pp. 389-398, (2016); Staubitz T., Pfeiffer T., Renz J., Willems C., Meinel C., Collaborative learning in a MOOC Environment, Proceedings of the 8th International Conference of Education, Research and Innovation (ICERI '15).

Comment Ranking Diversification in Forum Discussions,2017,WIP,Work in Progress,"Viewing consumption of discussion forums with hundreds or more comments depends on ranking because most users only view top-ranked comments. When comments are ranked by an ordered score (e.g. number of replies or up-votes) without adjusting for semantic similarity of near-ranked comments, top-ranked comments are more likely to emphasize the majority opinion and incur redundancy. In this paper, we propose a top K comment diversification re-ranking model using Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) and evaluate its impact in three categories: (1) semantic diversity, (2) inclusion of the semantics of lower-ranked comments, and (3) redundancy, within the context of a HarvardX course discussion forum. We conducted a double-blind, small-scale evaluation experiment requiring subjects to select between the top 5 comments of a diversified ranking and a baseline ranking ordered by score. For three subjects, across 100 trials, subjects selected the diversified (75% score, 25% diversification) ranking as significantly (1) more diverse, (2) more inclusive, and (3) less redundant. Within each category, inter-rater reliability showed moderate consistency, with typical Cohen-Kappa scores near 0.2. Our findings suggest that our model improves (1) diversification, (2) inclusion, and (3) redundancy, among top K ranked comments in discussion forums of online courses. © 2017 ACM.",,,,,,100,Comment ranking diversification in forum discussions,Northcutt C.G.; Leon K.A.; Chen N.,"Northcutt, Curtis G.

Criteria for Video Engagement in a Biology MOOC,2017,WIP,Work in Progress,"We have designed a Molecular Biology massive open online course (MOOC) for a global audience. Among the learning AIDS offered are two types of short video segments: lecture videos (delivered unscripted by a professor) and deep dives ( fully scripted and animated). While the engaged learners overwhelmingly watched the lecture video segments through to completion, some watched only a portion of each deep dive. As the deep dives take pains to follow evidence-based best practices and are more labor-intensive to make, further study of this difference in viewer retention would inform future course development decisions. Notably, course organization, length of video, lack of on-screen narrator, and identity of narrator show no correlation with this trend. Interestingly, learners who complete lecture videos but not deep dives have slightly higher overall course grades on average. Thus, our model is that learners with a higher degree of knowledge about the subject matter may feel that they do not need to complete the deep dive videos, while they feel the lecture videos are valuable. Future research will test this model. © 2017 ACM.",,,,,,100,Criteria for video engagement in a biology MOOC,Thornton S.; Riley C.; Wiltrout M.E.,"Thornton, Sera (57194034922); Riley, Ceri (57194040383); Wiltrout, Mary Ellen (36710817100)",57194034922; 57194040383; 36710817100,Criteria for video engagement in a biology MOOC,2017.0,L@S 2017 - Proceedings of the 4th (2017) ACM Conference on Learning at Scale,,,,291,294,3.0,6.0,10.1145/3051457.3054007,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018426350&doi=10.1145%2f3051457.3054007&partnerID=40&md5=e4c68218dfe38d6c37c26ed36dce5cef,"MIT, Cambridge, MA, United States","Thornton S., MIT, Cambridge, MA, United States; Riley C., MIT, Cambridge, MA, United States; Wiltrout M.E., MIT, Cambridge, MA, United States",Biology; MOOC; Online education; Video engagement,Biology; Curricula; Distance education; Image segmentation; Molecular biology; Course development; Course organization; Degree-of-knowledge; Labor intensive; Massive open online course; MOOC; On-line education; Video engagement; E-learning,,,,,,,"Clark R.C., Mayer R.E., E-Learning and the Science of Instruction: Proven Guidelines for Consumers and Designers of Multimedia Learning, (2008); Guo P.J., Kim J., Rubin R., How video production affects student engagement: An empirical study o f MOOC videos, Proceedings of the First ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale Conference, pp. 41-50, (2014); Hoffler T.N., Leutner D., Instructional animation versus static pictures: A meta-Analysis, Learning and Instruction, 17, pp. 722-738, (2007); Homer B.D., Plass J.L., Blake L., The effects of video on cognitive load and social presence in multimedia-learning, Computers in Human Behavior, 24, 3, pp. 786-797, (2008); Kim J., Guo P.J., Seaton D.T., Mitros P., Gajos K.Z., Miller R.C., Understanding in-video dropouts and interaction peaks in online lecture videos, Proceedings of the First ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale Conference, pp. 31-40, (2014); Lyons A., Reysen S., Pierce L., Video lecture format, student technological efficacy, and social presence in online courses, Computers in Human Behavior, 28, 1, pp. 181-186, (2012); McClean P., Johnson C., Rogers R., Daniels L., Reber J., Slator B.M., Terpstra J., White A., Molecular and cellular biology animations: Development and impact on student Learning, CBE Life Sci Educ, 4, 2, pp. 169-179, (2004)",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",Assoc. for Computing Machinery (ACM),"4th Annual ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2017",20 April 2017 through 21 April 2017,Cambridge,127333.0,,978-145034450-0,,,English,L@S - Proc.

Data-mining textual responses to uncover misconception patterns,2017,WIP,Work in Progress,"An important, yet largely unstudied, problem in student data analysis is to detect misconceptions from students' responses to open-response questions. Misconception detection enables instructors to deliver more targeted feedback on the misconceptions exhibited by many students in their class, thus improving the quality of instruction. In this paper, we propose D.TRUMP, a new natural language processing (NLP) framework to detect the common misconceptions among students' textual responses to open-response, short-Answer questions. We introduce a probabilistic model for students' textual responses involving misconceptions and experimentally validate it on a real-world student-response dataset. Preliminary experimental results show that D.TRUMP excels at classifying whether a response exhibits one or more misconceptions. More importantly, it can also automatically detect the common misconceptions exhibited across responses from multiple students to multiple questions; this is especially important at large scale, since instructors will no longer need to manually specify all possible misconceptions that students might exhibit. © 2017 ACM.",,,,,,93,D.TRUMP: Data-mining textual responses to uncover misconception patterns,Michalenko J.; Lan A.S.; Baraniuk R.G.,"Michalenko, Joshua (57194040218); Lan, Andrew S.

Deep Knowledge Tracing On Programming Exercises,2017,WIP,Work in Progress,"Modeling a student's knowledge state while she is solving exercises is a crucial stepping stone towards providing better personalized learning experiences at scale. This task, also referred to as ""knowledge tracing"", has been explored extensively on exercises where student submissions fall into a finite discrete solution space, e.g. a multiple-choice answer. However, we believe that rich information about a student's learning is captured within their responses to open-ended problems with unbounded solution spaces, such as programming exercises. In addition, sequential snapshots of a student's progress while she is solving a single exercise can provide valuable insights into her learning behavior. In this setting, creating representations for a student's knowledge state is a challenging task, but with recent advances in machine learning, there are more promising techniques to learn representations for complex entities. In our work, we feed the embedded program submissions into a recurrent neural network and train it on the task of predicting the student's success on the subsequent programming exercise. By training on this task, the model learns nuanced representations of a student's knowledge, and reliably predicts future student performance. © 2017 ACM.",,,,,,100,Deep knowledge tracing on programming exercises,Wang L.; Sy A.; Liu L.; Piech C.,"Wang, Lisa (57194036986); Sy, Angela (57194035240); Liu, Larry (57194036370); Piech, Chris (55142243300)",57194036986; 57194035240; 57194036370; 55142243300,Deep knowledge tracing on programming exercises,2017.0,L@S 2017 - Proceedings of the 4th (2017) ACM Conference on Learning at Scale,,,,201,204,3.0,71.0,10.1145/3051457.3053985,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018422818&doi=10.1145%2f3051457.3053985&partnerID=40&md5=0aca95a882db49611a9edabebdbab468,"Stanford University, Stanford, United States","Wang L., Stanford University, Stanford, United States; Sy A., Stanford University, Stanford, United States; Liu L., Stanford University, Stanford, United States; Piech C., Stanford University, Stanford, United States",Deep learning; Educational data mining; Knowledge tracing; Machine learning; Online education; Personalized learning; Representation learning; Sequential modeling,Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Deep learning; Distance education; E-learning; Education computing; Learning systems; Recurrent neural networks; Educational data mining; Knowledge tracings; On-line education; Personalized learning; Representation learning; Sequential model; Students,,,,,,,"Bengio Y., Courville A., Vincent P., Representation learning: A review and new perspectives, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 35, 8, pp. 1798-1828, (2013); Corbett A.T., Anderson J.R., Knowledge tracing: Modeling the acquisition of procedural knowledge, User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction, 4, 4, pp. 253-278, (1994); Hinton G.E., Salakhutdinov R.R., Reducing the dimensionality of data with neural networks, Science, 313, 5786, pp. 504-507, (2006); Hochreiter S., Schmidhuber J., Long short-Term memory, Neural Computation, 9, 8, pp. 1735-1780, (1997); Khajah M., Lindsey R.V., Mozer M.C., How Deep is Knowledge Tracing?, (2016); Mikolov T., Chen K., Corrado G., Dean J., Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space, (2013); Pardos Z.A., Heffernan N.T., Modeling individualization in a Bayesian networks implementation of knowledge tracing, International Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation, and Personalization, pp. 255-266, (2010); Piech C., Bassen J., Huang J., Ganguli S., Sahami M., Guibas L.J., Sohl-Dickstein J., Deep knowledge tracing, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 505-513, (2015); Piech C., Huang J., Nguyen A., Phulsuksombati M., Sahami M., Guibas L.J., Learning program embeddings to propagate feedback on student code, Corr, (2015); Piech C., Sahami M., Huang J., Guibas L., Autonomously generating hints by inferring problem solving policies, Proceedings of the Second (2015) ACM Conference on Learning@ Scale, pp. 195-204, (2015); Socher R., Perelygin A., Wu J.Y., Chuang J., Manning C.D., Ng A.Y., Potts C., Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank, Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), 1631, (2013); Wilson K.H., Karklin Y., Han B., Ekanadham C., Back to the Basics: Bayesian Extensions of IRT Outperform Neural Networks for Proficiency Estimation, (2016); Yudelson M.V., Koedinger K.R., Gordon G.J., Individualized Bayesian knowledge tracing models, International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education, pp. 171-180, (2013)",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",Assoc. for Computing Machinery (ACM),"4th Annual ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2017",20 April 2017 through 21 April 2017,Cambridge,127333.0,,978-145034450-0,,,English,L@S - Proc.

Preliminary findings suggest that the adaptivity of this kind leads to a higher efficiency of learning: students go through the course faster and attempt fewer problems, since the problems are served to them in a targeted way.

Do Performance Trends Suggest Wide-spread Collaborative Cheating on Asynchronous Exams?  111-120,2017,Full Paper,Integrity of Courses and Learners,"Using a data set from 29,492 asynchronous exams in an oncampus proctored computer-based testing facility (CBTF), we observed correlations between when a student chooses to take their exam within the exam period and their score on the exam. Somewhat surprisingly, instead of increasing throughout the exam period, which might be indicative of widespread collaborative cheating, we find that exam scores decrease throughout the exam period. While this could be attributed to weaker students putting off exams, this effect holds even when accounting for student ability as measured by a synchronous exam taken during the same semester. This suggests that precautions can be taken by a CBTF to maintain cheating at a low level (e.g., the level of proctored synchronous exams), in spite of the fact that students are taking their exams over a multi-day period. © 2017 ACM.",,,,,,95,Do performance trends suggest wide-spread collaborative cheating on asynchronous exams?,Chen B.; West M.; Zilles C.,"Chen, Binglin (57194035737); West, Matthew (36867775200); Zilles, Craig (6602243123)",57194035737; 36867775200; 6602243123,Do performance trends suggest wide-spread collaborative cheating on asynchronous exams?,2017.0,L@S 2017 - Proceedings of the 4th (2017) ACM Conference on Learning at Scale,,,,111,120,9.0,24.0,10.1145/3051457.3051465,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018443387&doi=10.1145%2f3051457.3051465&partnerID=40&md5=95995c8db54482ba3b0690c2c26aef82,"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, 61801, IL, United States","Chen B., University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, 61801, IL, United States; West M., University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, 61801, IL, United States; Zilles C., University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, 61801, IL, United States",Asynchronous exams; Cheating; Computerized testing; Student performance,Computer testing; Statistical tests; Asynchronous exams; Cheating; Computer-based testing; Computerized testing; Data set; Student performance; Wide spreads; Students,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF, (CMMI-1150490, DUE-1347722); Directorate for Education and Human Resources, EHR, (1347722); University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, UIUC","This work was partially supported by NSF DUE-1347722, NSF CMMI-1150490, and the College of Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign under the Strategic Instructional Initiatives Program (SIIP).","Azen R., Budescu D., Applications of Multiple Regression in Psychological Research, (2009); Becker B.J., Wu M.-J., The synthesis of regression slopes in meta-Analysis, Statist.

Enabling Real-Time Adaptivity in MOOCs with a Personalized Next-Step Recommendation Framework,2017,Full Paper,Engineering Learning Environments,"In this paper, we demonstrate a first-of-its-kind adaptive intervention in a MOOC utilizing real-Time clickstream data and a novel machine learned model of behavior. We detail how we augmented the edX platform with the capabilities necessary to support this type of intervention which required both tracking learners' behaviors in real-Time and dynamically adapting content based on each learner's individual clickstream history. Our chosen pilot intervention was in the category of adaptive pathways and courseware and took the form of a navigational suggestion appearing at the bottom of every non-forum content page in the course. We designed our pilot intervention to help students more efficiently navigate their way through a MOOC by predicting the next page they were likely to spend significant time on and allowing them to jump directly to that page. While interventions which attempt to optimize for learner achievement are candidates for this adaptive framework, behavior prediction has the benefit of not requiring causal assumptions to be made in its suggestions. We present a novel extension of a behavioral model that takes into account students' time spent on pages and forecasts the same. Several approaches to representing time using Recurrent Neural Networks are evaluated and compared to baselines without time, including a basic n-gram model. Finally, we discuss design considerations and handling of edge cases for real-Time deployment, including considerations for training a machine learned model on a previous offering of a course for use in a subsequent offering where courseware may have changed. This work opens the door to broad experimentation with adaptivity and serves as a first example of delivering a data-driven personalized learning experience in a MOOC. © 2017 ACM.",,,,,,100,Enabling real-Time adaptivity in MOOCs with a personalized next-step recommendation framework,Pardos Z.A.; Tang S.; Davis D.; Vu Le C.,"Pardos, Zachary A.

Enhancing the Experience Application Program Interface (xAPI) to Improve Domain Competency Modeling for Adaptive Instruction,2017,WIP,Work in Progress,"This paper describes methods for enhancing the experience application program interface (xAPI) to improve the assessment of domain competency modeling for adaptive instruction. xAPI is an e-learning software specification which allows individual learning experiences and achievements to be amassed in a Learning Record Store (LRS). Adaptive instruction includes tailored training or educational experiences usually delivered and guided by Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs). ITSs can more effectively tailor or adapt instruction when they have more accurate models of the learner's prior knowledge or competency. This paper examines the potential effect of methods to more accurately model learner experiences and domain competency in an LRS. Specifically, we recommend five methods to improve xAPI statements by documenting: 1) achievement types; 2) experience duration; 3) experience source information; 4) domain learning and forgetting; and 5) assessment within learning experiences. © 2017 ACM.",,,,,,100,Enhancing the experience application program interface (xAPI) to improve domain competency modeling for adaptive instruction,Sottilare R.A.; Long R.A.; Goldberg B.S.,"Sottilare, Robert A.

Epistemic Cognition: A Promising and Necessary Construct for Enriching Large-scale Online Learning Analysis,2017,Full Paper,Predicting and Explaining Learning,"Epistemic cognition refers to the process of thinking about one's forms of knowledge and ways of knowing. Epistemic cognition becomes especially critical when learners need to, assess the validity, certainty, reliability, source, and limits of their knowledge, as when working through ill-structured problems or evaluating contradictory knowledge claims. This psychological construct is relevant to Massively Open Online Courses (MOOCs), for instance, in that researchers are modeling learner behavior and performance (i.e., how learners handle knowledge) based on inferred learner knowledge states. In this synthesis paper, I provide a brief account of epistemic cognition research, summarize the field's key findings and theories, and outline the affordances that epistemic cognition offers to online learning researchers. I also show that, without knowing it, online learning researchers have already engaged with epistemic cognition concepts and provide recommendations for future, more theoretically and practically enriching work. © 2017 ACM.",,,,,,99,Epistemic cognition: A promising and necessaryconstruct for enrichinglarge-scale online learning analysis,Johanes P.,"Johanes, Petr (55793825700)",55793825700,Epistemic cognition: A promising and necessaryconstruct for enrichinglarge-scale online learning analysis,2017.0,L@S 2017 - Proceedings of the 4th (2017) ACM Conference on Learning at Scale,,,,61,69,8.0,7.0,10.1145/3051457.3051462,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018394549&doi=10.1145%2f3051457.3051462&partnerID=40&md5=c02e95c9716f63422048dfa061c4990b,"Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States","Johanes P., Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States",Epistemic cognition; Epistemology; Knowledge modeling; Mooc; Online learning,Epistemic cognition; Epistemology; Knowledge model; Mooc; Online learning; E-learning,,,,,,,"Magolda M.B.B., Evolution of a constructivist conceptualization of epistemological reflection, Educational Psychologist, 39, 1, pp. 31-42, (2004); Bendixen L.D., Rule D.C., An integrative approach to personal epistemology: A guiding model, Educational Psychologist, 39, 1, pp. 69-80, (2004); Braten I., Epistemic cognition interventions, Handbook of Epistemic Cognition, pp. 360-371, (2016); Brooks C., Thompson C., Teasley S., Who you are or What you Do: Comparing the Predictive Power of Demographics Vs.

Factor Analysis Reveals Student Thinking using the Mechanics Reasoning Inventory,2017,WIP,Work in Progress,"The Mechanics Reasoning Inventory (MRI) [1] is an assessment instrument specifically designed to assess strategic reasoning skills involving core concepts in introductory Newtonian mechanics. Being an assessment of higher order thinking (as opposed to declarative or rule-based procedural thinking), it is necessary to check whether or not the mental constructs underlying actual student responses correlate with the authors' domain classification, which is the subject of this paper. The instrument consists of three types of problems: Whether momentum or energy is conserved in a given situation and why, (partly inspired by the paired what/why questions in Lawson's Classroom Test of Scientific Reasoning), application of Newton's 2nd and 3rd law, and decomposing problems into parts (inspired by Van Domelen [2]'s Problem Decomposition Diagnostic). It has been administered 183 times in two MIT courses since 2009. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) revealed that each Lawson pair of questions should be considered as one item, after which it identified four factors among the 21 questions that correspond reasonably well with the intended physics topics, and a fifth factor correlated with the concept of circular motion, a difficult topic for students (even though not viewed as a core principle by the designers). We discuss why 6 of the items classified under factors that differed from the expert assignments. There was no strong indication that the students answered each of different problem types similarly, which is a hallmark of students using novice heuristics rather than reasoning based on physical principles to answer the questions. © 2017 ACM.",,,,,,100,Factor analysis reveals student thinking using the mechanics reasoning inventory,Lee S.; Kimn A.; Chen Z.; Paul A.; Pritchard D.,"Lee, Sunbok (57192521363); Kimn, Alex (57194039586); Chen, Zhengzhou (7409482654); Paul, Andrew (57194046826); Pritchard, David (7201794914)",57192521363; 57194039586; 7409482654; 57194046826; 7201794914,Factor analysis reveals student thinking using the mechanics reasoning inventory,2017.0,L@S 2017 - Proceedings of the 4th (2017) ACM Conference on Learning at Scale,,,,197,200,3.0,2.0,10.1145/3051457.3053984,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018389198&doi=10.1145%2f3051457.3053984&partnerID=40&md5=92d8e5cd41ca811d48fd9805b3f221c0,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States; University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, United States; University of Wisconsin, Platteville, WI, United States","Lee S., Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States; Kimn A., Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States; Chen Z., University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, United States; Paul A., University of Wisconsin, Platteville, WI, United States; Pritchard D., Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States",Exploratory factor analysis; Mechanical reasoning inventory,Decomposition; Education; Mechanics; Multivariant analysis; Students; Teaching; Assessment instruments; Exploratory factor analysis; Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA); Higher-order thinkings; Mechanical reasoning; Problem decomposition; Scientific reasoning; Strategic reasoning; Factor analysis,,,,,,,"Pawl A., Barrantes A., Cardamone C., Rayyan S., Pritchard D.E., Rebello N.S., Engelhardt P.V., Singh C., Development of a mechanics reasoning inventory, Physics Education Research Conference, pp. 287-290, (2011); Domelen D.V., The Development of the Problem Decomposition Diagnostic, (2000); Chi M.T.H., Feltovich P.J., Glaser R., Categorization and representation of physics problems by experts and novices, Cognitive Science, 5, pp. 121-152, (1981); Tuminaro J., Redish E., Elements of a cognitive model of physics problem solving: Epistemic games, Physical Review Special Topics - Physics Education Research, 3, 2, pp. 1-22, (2007); Nunnally J.C., Bernstein I.H., Ten Berge J.M.F., Psychometric theory, JSTOR, (1967); Revelle W., Hierarchical cluster analysis and TIHE internal structure o f tests, Multivariate Behavwral Research, 14, pp. 57-74, (1979); Muthen L.K., Muthen B.O., Mplus User's Guide: Statistical Analysis with Latent Variables: User'ss Guide, (2010); Tuminaro J., Redish E., Elements of a cognitive model of physics problem solving: Epistemic games, Physical Review Special Topics - Physics Education Research, 3, 2, pp. 1-22, (2007)",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",Assoc. for Computing Machinery (ACM),"4th Annual ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2017",20 April 2017 through 21 April 2017,Cambridge,127333.0,,978-145034450-0,,,English,L@S - Proc.

Formal Forum Triage: Towards the Strategic Selection of Responses to Student Discussion Forums,2017,WIP,Work in Progress,"It can be difficult for educators with limited resources to decide which queries need immediate attention when a high volume of questions arises on the discussion forum. This becomes increasingly complex as the educator aims to obtain the best outcome across all threads in a timely fashion. Existing approaches to automated forum analysis provide a useful grouping of messages and identify common discussions, but require additional attention to- wards effective intervention.

"Getting to Know English Language Learners in MOOCs: Their Motivations, Behaviors, and Outcomes",2017,WIP,Work in Progress,"Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) promise to engage a global audience and emphasize the democratic achievement of free, university-level education. While such open access enables participation, it is unclear how learners who are not fluent in English (ELLs) engage with MOOC content. After all, the language of MOOCs is English. In order to improve accessibility for ELLs in digital learning environments, we must first have a clear understanding of the educational landscape: Who are the non-native English speakers enrolled in MOOCs? Where are they located geographically? What are their current online learning behaviors, motivations and outcomes? In this paper we start answering some of these questions by analyzing data from 100 HarvardX courses, using self-report and log data. Preliminary analysis show evidence that ELLs are motivated by more utilitarian goals compared to non-ELLs. © 2017 ACM.",,,,,,99,"Getting to know english language learners in MOOCs: Their motivations, behaviors and outcomes",Türkay S.; Seaton D.; Eidelman H.; Lopez G.; Rosen Y.; Whitehill J.,"Türkay, Selen (36544543100); Seaton, Daniel (15042760500); Eidelman, Hadas (57194028723); Lopez, Glenn (57189381406); Rosen, Yigal (18042058000); Whitehill, Jacob (24826006100)",36544543100; 15042760500; 57194028723; 57189381406; 18042058000; 24826006100,"Getting to know english language learners in MOOCs: Their motivations, behaviors and outcomes",2017.0,L@S 2017 - Proceedings of the 4th (2017) ACM Conference on Learning at Scale,,,,209,212,3.0,7.0,10.1145/3051457.3053987,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018399726&doi=10.1145%2f3051457.3053987&partnerID=40&md5=198f0201beced6ebfe9b5c1c9489dfda,"Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, United States; Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA, United States","Türkay S., Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, United States; Seaton D., Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, United States; Eidelman H., Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, United States; Lopez G., Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, United States; Rosen Y., Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, United States; Whitehill J., Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA, United States",Behaviors; English language learners; MOOCs; Motivations; Outcomes,Computer aided instruction; Education; Motivation; Behaviors; Digital learning environment; English languages; Massive open online course; MOOCs; Outcomes; Preliminary analysis; University levels; E-learning,,,,,,,"Beaven T., Comas-Quinn A., Hauck M., Arcos B.D.L., Lewis T., The Open Translation MOOC: Creating online communities to transcend linguistic barriers, Journal of Interactive Media in Education, 3, (2013); Burgstahler S., Distance learning: Universal design, universal access, Educational Technology Review, 10, 1, pp. 32-61, (2002); Chen R.T.-H., Bennett S., Maton K., The adaptation of Chinese international students to online flexible learning: Two case studies, Distance Education, 29, 3, pp. 307-323, (2008); Guokr, (2015); Kena G., Et al., The condition of education 2015, NCES 2015-144., (2015); Kolowich S., The professors who make the MOOCs, The Chronicle of Higher Education, (2013); Linebarger D.L., Learning to read from television: The effects of using captions and narration, Journal of Educational Psychology, 93, 2, pp. 288-298, (2001); Shea P., Leveling the playing field: A study of captioned interactive video for second language learning, Journal of Educational Computing Research, 22, 3, pp. 243-263, (2000); Uchidiuno J., Ogan A., Koedinger K.R., Yarzebinski E., Hammer J., Browser language preferences as a metric for identifying ESL speakers in MOOCs, ACM, pp. 277-280, (2016); Changes in Population Controls, (2011); Laere E.V., Agirdag O., Braak J.V., Supporting science learning in linguistically diverse classrooms: Factors related to the use of bilingual content in a computer-based learning environment, Computers in Human Behavior, 57, pp. 428-441, (2016); Zhang Y., Power distance in online learning: Experience of Chinese learners in U.S. Higher education, The International Review of Research in Open and Distributed Learning, 14, (2013)",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",Assoc. for Computing Machinery (ACM),"4th Annual ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2017",20 April 2017 through 21 April 2017,Cambridge,127333.0,,978-145034450-0,,,English,L@S - Proc.

This paper details the functionality of edx2bigquery -An open source Python package developed by Harvard and MIT to ingest and report on hundreds of MITx and HarvardX course datasets from edX, making use of Google BigQuery to handle multiple terabytes of learner data. For this application, we find that Google BigQuery provides ease of use in loading the multi-faceted MOOC datasets and near real-Time interactive querying of data, including large clickstream datasets; moreover, we are able to provide flexible research and reporting dashboards, visualizing and aggregating data, by interfacing services associated with BigQuery. This framework makes it feasible for edx2bigquery to be open source, following standards which emphasize the importance of data products that transcend a particular data science platform and allow teams with diverse backgrounds to interact with data. edx2bigquery is being adopted by other institutions with an aim toward future collaboration. © 2017 ACM.",,,,,,100,Google BigQuery for education: Framework for parsing and analyzing edX MOOC data,Lopez G.; Seaton D.T.; Ang A.; Tingley D.; Chuang I.,"Lopez, Glenn (57189381406); Seaton, Daniel T.

"Gradescope: A Fast, Flexible, and Fair System for Scalable Assessment of Handwritten Work",2017,Full Paper,Feedback for Improving Learning,"We present a system for online assessment of handwritten homework assignments and exams. First, either instructors or students scan and upload handwritten work. Instructors then grade the work and distribute the results using a web-based platform. Our system optimizes for three key dimensions: speed, consistency, and flexibility. The primary innovation enabling improvements in all three dimensions is a dynamically evolving rubric for each question on an assessment. We also describe how the system minimizes the overhead incurred in the digitization process. Our system has been in use for four years, with instructors at 200 institutions having graded over 10 million pages of student work. We present results as user-reported data and feedback regarding time saved grading, enjoyment, and student experience. Two-Thirds of responders report saving 30% or more time relative to their traditional workflow. We also find that the time spent grading an individual response to a question rapidly decays with the number of responses to that question that the grader has already graded. © 2017 ACM.",,,,,,100,"Gradescope: A fast, flexible, and fair system for scalable assessment of handwritten work",Singh A.; Karayev S.; Gutowski K.; Abbeel P.,"Singh, Arjun (56733528800); Karayev, Sergey (50561748500); Gutowski, Kevin (57194034007); Abbeel, Pieter (8269962600)",56733528800; 50561748500; 57194034007; 8269962600,"Gradescope: A fast, flexible, and fair system for scalable assessment of handwritten work",2017.0,L@S 2017 - Proceedings of the 4th (2017) ACM Conference on Learning at Scale,,,,81,88,7.0,59.0,10.1145/3051457.3051466,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018456836&doi=10.1145%2f3051457.3051466&partnerID=40&md5=150b98cd89ca99c249e6ea894bf8bbed,"Gradescope Inc., Berkeley, CA, United States; UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, United States","Singh A., Gradescope Inc., Berkeley, CA, United States; Karayev S., Gradescope Inc., Berkeley, CA, United States; Gutowski K., Gradescope Inc., Berkeley, CA, United States; Abbeel P., UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, United States",Computer-Assisted instruction; Education; Learning assessment; Rubric-based grading; Scaling large courses,Education; Grading; Students; Computer Assisted Instruction; Homework assignments; Learning assessment; On-line assessment; Scaling large courses; Student experiences; Three dimensions; Web based platform; Computer aided instruction,,,,,,,"Bloomfield A., Evolution of a digital paper exam grading system, Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE), (2010); Bloomfield A., Groves J.F., A tablet-based paper exam grading system, ACM SIGCSE Bulletin, 40, pp. 83-87, (2008); Cheang B., Kurnia A., Lim A., Oon W.-C., On automated grading of programming assignments in an academic institution, Computers & Education, 41, 2, pp. 121-131, (2003); Cummins R., Zhang M., Briscoe T., Constrained Multi-Task Learning for Automated Essay Scoring, (2016); Eberhard A., Sheridan D., The transition to online marking in large classes, EdMedia: World Conference on Educational Media and Technology, 2015, pp. 371-376, (2015); Embretson S.E., Reise S.P., Item Response Theory, (2013); Hattie J., Visible Learning: A Synthesis of over 800 Meta-Analyses Relating to Achievement, (2008); Helmick M.T., Interface-based programming assignments and automatic grading of Java programs, ACM SIGCSE Bulletin, 39, pp. 63-67, (2007); Jonsson A., Svingby G., The use of scoring rubrics: Reliability, validity and educational consequences, Educational Research Review, 2, 2, pp. 130-144, (2007); Kwon Y.P., McMains S., An automated grading/feedback system for 3-view engineering drawings using RANSAC, Proceedings of the Second (2015) ACM Conference on Learning@ Scale, pp. 157-166, (2015); Malan D.J., CS50 sandbox: Secure execution of untrusted code, Proceeding of the 44th ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education, pp. 141-146, (2013); Park J., Hagen J., Managing large volumes of assignments, Educause Quarterly, (2005); Reddy Y.M., Andrade H., A review of rubric use in higher education, Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education, 35, 4, pp. 435-448, (2010); Schleimer S., Wilkerson D.S., Aiken A., Winnowing: Local algorithms for document fingerprinting, Proceedings of the 2003 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, pp. 76-85, (2003); Schneider S.C., Paperless grading of handwritten homework: Electronic process and assessment, ASEE North Midwest Section Conference, (2014); Sheridan D., Gardner L., From cellulose to software: The evolution of a marking system, World Conference on Educational Multimedia, Hypermedia and Telecommunications, 2012, pp. 454-461, (2012); Stevens D.D., Levi A., Introduction to rubrics: An assessment tool to save grading time, Convey Effective Feedback, and Promote Student Learning, (2005); Valenti S., Neri F., Cucchiarelli A., An overview of current research on automated essay grading, Journal of Information Technology Education, 2, pp. 319-330, (2003)",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",Assoc. for Computing Machinery (ACM),"4th Annual ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2017",20 April 2017 through 21 April 2017,Cambridge,127333.0,,978-145034450-0,,,English,L@S - Proc.

Improving Assessment on MOOCs Through Peer Identification and Aligned Incentives,2017,WIP,Work in Progress,"Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) use peer assessment to grade open ended questions at scale, allowing students to provide feedback. Relative to teacher based grading, peer assessment on MOOCs traditionally delivers lower quality feedback and fewer learner interactions. We present the identified peer review (IPR) framework, which provides non-blind peer assessment and incentives driving high quality feedback. We show that, compared to traditional peer assessment methods, IPR leads to significantly longer and more useful feedback as well as more discussion between peers. © 2017 ACM.",,,,,,100,Improving assessment on MOOCs through peer identification and aligned incentives,Gamage D.; Whiting M.E.; Rajapakshe T.; Thilakarathne H.; Perera I.; Fernando S.,"Gamage, Dilrukshi (37035732200); Whiting, Mark E.

In-Video Reuse of Discussion Threads in MOOCs,2017,WIP,Work in Progress,"In MOOCs, both instructors and students invest substantial effort into discussion forums. However, those discussions are abandoned when instructors start a new session in session-based courses. In an observational field study through a popular online Coursera course, we evaluate an approach that directly embeds high-value past discussion threads into future lecture videos to reuse them. Survey feedback shows that this approach can be useful to a large proportion of learners. We find that instructor involvement increases learners' chance of reading the threads, reduces learners' negative reactions, but is not associated with more perceived usefulness. Learners perceive enhancing threads embedded in the middle of videos less enhancing but more explanatory compared with at the end. Embedding explanatory threads at the end is rated less distracting and more helpful to understand the video compared with in the middle, right after the related content is lectured. © 2017 ACM.",,,,,,100,In-video reuse of discussion threads in MOOCs,Zhao Q.; Varma S.; Konstan J.A.,"Zhao, Qian (57188817517); Varma, Sashank (14066713400); Konstan, Joseph A.

Incorporating Rich Features into Deep Knowledge Tracing,2017,WIP,Work in Progress,"The desire to follow student learning within intelligent tutoring systems in near real time has led to the development of several models anticipating the correctness of the next item as students work through an assignment. Such models have included Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT), Performance Factors Analysis (PFA), and more recently with developments in deep learning, Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT). This DKT model, based on the use of a recurrent neural network, exhibited promising results. Thus far, however, the model has only considered the knowledge components of the problems and correctness as input, neglecting the breadth of other features collected by computer-based learning platforms. This work seeks to improve upon the DKT model by incorporating more features at the problem-level. With this higher dimensional input, an adaption to the original DKT model structure is also proposed, incorporating an auto-encoder network layer to convert the input into a low dimensional feature vector to reduce both the resource requirement and time needed to train. Experiment results show that our adapted DKT model, observing more combinations of features, can effectively improve accuracy. © 2017 ACM.",,,,,,100,Incorporating rich features into deep knowledge tracing,Zhang L.; Xiong X.; Zhao S.; Botelho A.; Heffernan N.T.,"Zhang, Liang (57194046269); Xiong, Xiaolu (57199839343); Zhao, Siyuan (57194028898); Botelho, Anthony (56597707600); Heffernan, Neil T.

Intelligent Math Tutor: Problem-Based Approach to Create Cognizance,2017,WIP,Work in Progress,"Mathematical word problems (or story problems) allow students to apply their mathematical problem solving ability to other subjects and real-world situations. Word problems build higher-order thinking, critical problem-solving, and reasoning skills. Generally solving a word problem is associated with mathematical modeling of a real word situation or a concept of another subject which is embedded in the problem. Manually creating word problems require knowledge of other topics a student is learning in parallel. Besides this, modeling mathematics with some other dissociated concept is a time-consuming and labor-intensive task. Due to lack of this integrated knowledge of other topics being taught, the substantive breadth of word problems is often very narrow and is limited to very few concepts. To address this limitation, we built a tool called Intelligent Math Tutor (IMT), which automatically generates mathematical word problems such that teachings from other subjects from a given curriculum can also be incorporated. Our tool thus widens the scope of word problems and uses this problem-solving based approach to indirectly create cognizance in its students. To the best of our knowledge, our tool is the first of its kind tool which explicitly blends knowledge from multiple dissociated subjects and uses it to enhance the cognizance of its learners. © 2017 ACM.",,,,,,100,Intelligent math tutor: Problem-based approach to create cognizance,Gupta M.; Gantayat N.; Sindhgatta R.,"Gupta, Monika (58510566300); Gantayat, Neelamadhav (51161373600); Sindhgatta, Renuka (8853417600)",58510566300; 51161373600; 8853417600,Intelligent math tutor: Problem-based approach to create cognizance,2017.0,L@S 2017 - Proceedings of the 4th (2017) ACM Conference on Learning at Scale,,,,241,244,3.0,5.0,10.1145/3051457.3053995,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018448085&doi=10.1145%2f3051457.3053995&partnerID=40&md5=ccef561c72df5b78a8798f4f7be48701,"IBM Research, India","Gupta M., IBM Research, India; Gantayat N., IBM Research, India; Sindhgatta R., IBM Research, India",Concept mapping; Integrated curriculum; Intelligent math tutor; Mathematical word problems,Curricula; Students; Teaching; Concept mapping; Critical problems; Higher-order thinkings; Intelligent math tutor; Labor intensive; Mathematical problem solving; Real world situations; Word problem; Problem solving,,,,,,,"Furner J.M., Kumar D.D., The mathematics and science integration argument: A stand for teacher education, Eurasia Journal of Mathematics, Science & Technology Education; Frykholm J., Glasson G., Connecting science and mathematics instruction: Pedagogical context knowledge for teachers, School Science and Mathematics, 105, 3, pp. 127-141, (2005); Koirala H.P., Bowman J.K., Preparing middle level preservice teachers to integrate mathematics and science: Problems and possibilities, School Science and Mathematics, 145, 10, pp. 145-154, (2003); Olney A.M., Graesser A.C., Person N.K., Question generation from concept maps, Dialogs and Discourse, 3, 2, pp. 75-99, (2012); Heilman M., Smith N.A., Good Question!

Learning about Learning at Scale: Methodological Challenges and Recommendations,2017,Full Paper,Experimentation,"Learning at scale opens up a new frontier to learn about learning. Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs) and similar large-scale online learning platforms give an unprecedented view of learners' behavior whilst learning. In this paper, we argue that the abundance of data that results from such platforms not only brings novel opportunities to the study of learning, but also bears novel methodological challenges. We show that the resulting data comes with various challenges with respect to the granular, observational, and large nature of these data. Additionally, we discuss a series of potential solutions, such as sharing validated models and performing pre-registered confirmatory research. With these contributions, this paper aims to increase awareness and understanding of both the strengths and challenges of research on learning at scale. © 2017 ACM.",,,,,,100,Learning about learning at scale: Methodological challenges and recommendations,Van Der Sluis F.; Van Der Zee T.; Ginn J.,"Van Der Sluis, Frans (35743909500); Van Der Zee, Tim (57163561300); Ginn, Jasper (57189383661)",35743909500; 57163561300; 57189383661,Learning about learning at scale: Methodological challenges and recommendations,2017.0,L@S 2017 - Proceedings of the 4th (2017) ACM Conference on Learning at Scale,,,,131,140,9.0,16.0,10.1145/3051457.3051461,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018367776&doi=10.1145%2f3051457.3051461&partnerID=40&md5=e9a2b75740d0315c0c6a9b73b85c4159,"Online Learning Lab, Leiden University, The Hague, Netherlands; Graduate School of Teaching, Leiden University, Leiden, Netherlands","Van Der Sluis F., Online Learning Lab, Leiden University, The Hague, Netherlands; Van Der Zee T., Graduate School of Teaching, Leiden University, Leiden, Netherlands; Ginn J., Online Learning Lab, Leiden University, The Hague, Netherlands",Behavioral traces; Big data; Learning analytics; Online learning; Research methodology; Research validity,Big data; Behavioral trace; Learning analytics; Online learning; Research methodologies; E-learning,,,,,,,"Bergner R.M., What is behavior?

Learning to Code in Localized Programming Languages,2017,Full Paper,Learn to Code,"Education research suggests that learning in one's local language can have a positive impact on learning outcomes. We offer a quantitative test of the association between local language use and the rate at which youth learn to program. Using longitudinal data drawn from five countries and over 15,000 users of Scratch, a large informal learning community, we find that novice users who code with their programming language keywords and environment localized into their home countries' primary language demonstrate new programming concepts at a faster rate than users from the same countries whose interface is in English. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of our findings for designers of online learning systems. © 2017 ACM.",,,,,,100,Learning to code in localized programming languages,Dasgupta S.; Hill B.M.,"Dasgupta, Sayamindu (39061169700); Hill, Benjamin Mako (35772345700)",39061169700; 35772345700,Learning to code in localized programming languages,2017.0,L@S 2017 - Proceedings of the 4th (2017) ACM Conference on Learning at Scale,,,,33,39,6.0,27.0,10.1145/3051457.3051464,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018416272&doi=10.1145%2f3051457.3051464&partnerID=40&md5=b0e42e89532e1674b1859c7994c6afa3,"MIT Media Lab, Cambridge, 02142, MA, United States; University of Washington, Seattle, 98195, WA, United States","Dasgupta S., MIT Media Lab, Cambridge, 02142, MA, United States; Hill B.M., University of Washington, Seattle, 98195, WA, United States",H.5.2 Information interfaces and presentation (e.g. HCI): User interfaces; K.3.2 Computer and information science education: Computer science education,Online systems; Software testing; User interfaces; Computer Science Education; Education research; Informal learning; Information interfaces and presentations; Longitudinal data; On-line learning systems; Programming concepts; Quantitative tests; Education computing,,,,,"MIT Media Lab for creating Scratch; Mitchel Resnick; National Science Foundation, NSF, (1417663, DRL-1417663, DRL-1417952)","We are grateful to the Lifelong Kindergarten group at the MIT Media Lab for creating Scratch and for continuing to support the growth of the community and the technical platform.

Long-Term Peer Reviewing Effort is Anti-Reciprocal,2017,WIP,Work in Progress,"Many studies demonstrate that peer reviewing provides pedagogical benefits such as inspiration and developing expert vision, and changes classroom culture by encouraging reciprocity. However, much large-scale research in peer assessment has focused on MOOCs, where students have short tenures, and is unable to describe how reciprocity-oriented classroom cultures evolve over time. This short paper presents the first long-Term analysis of peer reviewing with 304 students, conducted in three large physical classes in a year-long undergraduate series. Surprisingly, this analysis reveals that when students receive better reviews on their work, they write worse reviews in the future. This suggests that while students believe in the reciprocal nature of peer review, they act anti-reciprocally. Therefore, battling the emergent norm of anti-reciprocity is crucial both for system designers and practitioners who use peer assessment. © 2017 ACM.",,,,,,100,Long-Term peer reviewing effort is anti-reciprocal,Kotturi Y.;

MOOC Dropout Prediction: How to Measure Accuracy?  161-164,2017,WIP,Work in Progress,"In order to obtain reliable accuracy estimates for auto- matic MOOC dropout predictors, it is important to train and test them in a manner consistent with how they will be used in practice. Yet most prior research on MOOC dropout prediction has measured test accuracy on the same course used for training, which can lead to overly optimistic accuracy estimates. In order to understand better how accuracy is affected by the training+testing regime, we compared the accuracy of a standard dropout prediction architecture (clickstream features + logistic regression) across 4 different training paradigms. Results suggest that (1) training and testing on the same course (\post-hoc"") can significantly overestimate accu- racy. Moreover, (2) training dropout classifiers using proxy labels based on students' persistence - which are available before a MOOC finishes - is surprisingly com- petitive with post-hoc training (87:33% v. 90:20% AUC averaged over 8 weeks of 40 HarvardX MOOCs) and can support real-Time MOOC interventions. © 2017 ACM.",,,,,,92,MOOC dropout prediction: How to measure accuracy?,Whitehill J.; Mohan K.; Seaton D.; Rosen Y.; Tingley D.,"Whitehill, Jacob (24826006100); Mohan, Kiran (57194042916); Seaton, Daniel (15042760500); Rosen, Yigal (18042058000); Tingley, Dustin (12446550300)",24826006100; 57194042916; 15042760500; 18042058000; 12446550300,MOOC dropout prediction: How to measure accuracy?,2017.0,L@S 2017 - Proceedings of the 4th (2017) ACM Conference on Learning at Scale,,,,161,164,3.0,44.0,10.1145/3051457.3053974,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018371405&doi=10.1145%2f3051457.3053974&partnerID=40&md5=1c51996303efc97b29db9ec82e75c1ae,"Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA, United States; Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, United States","Whitehill J., Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA, United States; Mohan K., Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA, United States; Seaton D., Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, United States; Rosen Y., Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, United States; Tingley D., Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, United States",,Clickstreams; Logistic regressions; Measure-accuracy; Real time; Test accuracy; Training and testing; Forecasting,,,,,,,"Balakrishnan G., Coetzee D., Predicting Student Retention in Massive Open Online Courses Using Hidden Markov Models, (2013); Boyer S., Veeramachaneni K., Transfer learning for predictive models in massive open online courses, International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education, (2015); Coleman C., Seaton D., Chuang I., Probabilistic use cases: Discovering behavioral patterns for predicting certification, Learning at Scale, (2015); Crossley S., Paquette L., Dascalu M., McNamara D.S., Baker R.S., Combining click-stream data with nlp tools to better understand MOOC completion, Learning Analytics & Knowledge, pp. 6-14, (2016); Fei M., Yeung D.-Y., Temporal models for predicting student dropout in massive open online courses, International Conference on Data Mining Workshop (ICDMW), (2015); Halawa S., Greene D., Mitchell J., Dropout prediction in MOOCs using learner activity features, European MOOC Summit, (2014); He J., Bailey J., Benjamin, Rubinstein I., Zhang R., Identifying at-risk students in massive open online courses, AAAI, (2015); Jiang S., Williams A., Schenke K., Warschauer M., O'Dowd D., Predicting MOOC performance with week 1 behavior, Educational Data Mining, (2014); Kizilcec R., Halawa S., Attrition and achievement gaps in online learning, Learning at Scale, (2015); Kloft M., Stiehler F., Zheng Z., Pinkwart N., Predicting MOOC dropout over weeks using machine learning methods, Proceedings of the EMNLP 2014 Workshop on Analysis of Large Scale Social Interaction in MOOCs, pp. 60-65, (2014); Koedinger K.R., Kim J., Jia J.Z., McLaughlin E.A., Bier N.L., Learning is not a spectator sport: Doing is better than watching for learning from a MOOC, Learning at Scale, (2015); Robinson C., Yeomans M., Reich J., Hulleman C., Gehlbach H., Forecasting student achievement in MOOCs with natural language processing, Learning Analytics & Knowledge, (2016); Rose C.P., Carlson R., Yang D., Wen M., Resnick L., Goldman P., Sherer J., Social factors that contribute to attrition in MOOCs, Learning at Scale, pp. 197-198, (2014); Stein R., Allione G., Mass attrition: An analysis of drop out from a principles of microeconomics MOOC, PIER Working Paper, 14, 31, (2014); Taylor C., Veeramachaneni K., O'Reilly U.-M., Likely to Stop?

MOOClets: A Framework for Dynamic Experimentation and Personalization,2017,WIP,Work in Progress,"Randomized experiments in online educational environments are ubiquitous as a scientific method for investigating learning and motivation, but they rarely improve educational resources and produce practical benefits for learners. We suggest that tools for experimentally comparing resources are designed primarily through the lens of experiments as a scientific methodology, and therefore miss a tremendous opportunity for online experiments to serve as engines for dynamic improvement and personalization. We present the MOOClet requirements specification to guide the implementation of software tools for experiments to ensure that whenever alternative versions of a resource can be experimentally compared (by randomly assigning versions), the resource can also be dynamically improved (by changing which versions are presented), and personalized (by presenting different versions to different people). The MOOClet specification was used to implement DEXPER, a proof-of-concept web service backend that enables dynamic experimentation and personalization of resources embedded in frontend educational platforms. We describe three use cases of MOOClets for dynamic experimentation and personalization of motivational emails, explanations, and problems. © 2017 ACM.",,,,,,100,MOOClets: A framework for dynamic experimentation and personalization,Jaywilliams J.; Rafferty A.N.; Maldonado S.; Ang A.; Tingley D.; Kim J.,"Jaywilliams, Joseph (57194039312); Rafferty, Anna N.

Mobilizing the Crowd to Create an Open Repository of Research Talks,2017,WIP,Work in Progress,"While most existing research knowledge is distributed in the form of papers, there has been a shift towards learning and consuming information through video. Limited time and resources, however, prevent individual researchers from making their work available in this format. Crowdsourcing this task is a promising alternative, but it requires solving complex coordination and collaborative video production problems. In this paper, we propose an end-To-end solution to crowdsource the creation of research videos. To assist coordination, we designed a structured workflow that enables efficient delegation of tasks, while also providing collaborative learning environment to the crowd for motivation. To facilitate video production, we developed an online system through which groups can make micro audio recordings that are automatically stitched together to create a complete talk. We tested this approach with a group of volunteers recruited from 24 countries through an open call. This distributed crowd produced five video talks based on the best paper winners and nominees from WWW 2016. Evaluations from the authors of the papers and outside reviewers rated the talks ""very good"" (giving a median score of 4 out of 5). We further applied this method to translate these talks and produce 11 additional videos in Spanish, Romanian, and Catalan. These results suggest that our crowdsourcing approach has the potential to significantly increase learning and the accessibility of the scientific knowledge. © 2017 ACM.",,,,,,100,Mobilizing the crowd to create an open repository of research talks,Vaish R.; Goel S.; Saberi A.,"Vaish, Rajan (55883417000); Goel, Sharad (35785827100); Saberi, Amin (57222707276)",55883417000; 35785827100; 57222707276,Mobilizing the crowd to create an open repository of research talks,2017.0,L@S 2017 - Proceedings of the 4th (2017) ACM Conference on Learning at Scale,,,,311,314,3.0,0.0,10.1145/3051457.3054012,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018405216&doi=10.1145%2f3051457.3054012&partnerID=40&md5=9a301e1e4908567b294d8aae528a8eb8,"Stanford University, United States","Vaish R., Stanford University, United States; Goel S., Stanford University, United States; Saberi A., Stanford University, United States",Crowdsourcing; Online creative collaboration; Peer video production; Scientific knowledge/learning at scale,Coordination reactions; Crowdsourcing; Online systems; Video recording; Catalans; Collaborative learning environment; End-to-end solutions; Online creative collaboration; Open repositories; Romanians; Scientific knowledge; Video production; Computer aided instruction,,,,,,,"Stanford Scholar, (2016); Nominees and Winners for Best Paper and Best Student Paper - WWW 2016, (2016); Guo P.J., Kim J., Rubin R., How video production affects student engagement: An empirical study of MOOC Videos, Proceedings of the First ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale Conference (L@S '14), pp. 41-50, (2014); Lashinsky A., Inside Apple, (2012); Luther K., Fiesler C., Bruckman A., Redistributing leadership in online creative collaboration, Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work, pp. 1007-1022, (2013)",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",Assoc. for Computing Machinery (ACM),"4th Annual ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2017",20 April 2017 through 21 April 2017,Cambridge,127333.0,,978-145034450-0,,,English,L@S - Proc.

Modeling MOOC Student Behavior With Two-Layer Hidden Markov Models,2017,WIP,Work in Progress,"Massive open online courses (MOOCs) provide educators with an abundance of data describing how students interact with the platform, but this data is highly underutilized today. This is in part due to the lack of sophisticated tools to provide interpretable and actionable summaries of huge amounts of MOOC activity present in log data.

Observing Personalizations in Learning: Identifying Heterogeneous Treatment Effects Using Causal Trees,2017,WIP,Work in Progress,"The incorporation of computer-based platforms in the classroom has introduced the ability to conduct numerous randomized control trials at scale with student-level randomization. Such systems are able to collect vast amounts of data on each student while completing work in the classroom and at home. It is often the case, however, that the effects of these trials are reported across all students, ignoring the potential for personalized learning. Personalized learning, or the observation of heterogeneous treatment effects, considers that the effects of a studied learning intervention may differ for individual students; while an intervention may work well for low-performing students, for example, it may have no effect for higher performing students. Personalized learning can lead to better instructional practices that maximizes the learning benefits for each individual student, and with the use of computer-based platforms, such individualized instruction is made feasible at large scales. In this work we use a causal decision tree to observe treatment effects in 9 experiments run in the ASSISTments online learning platform. © 2017 ACM.",,,,,,100,Observing personalizations in learning: Identifying heterogeneous treatment effects using causal trees,Yin B.; Patikorn T.; Botelho A.F.; Heffernan N.T.,"Yin, Biao (57194044631); Patikorn, Thanaporn (57189378994); Botelho, Anthony F.

One Decision Tree is Enough to Make Customization,2017,WIP,Work in Progress,"The ability to customize instruction to individuals is a great potential for adaptive educational software. Unfortunately, beyond mastery learning and learner control, there has not been much work with adapting instruction to individuals. This paper provides an approach to determine what type of learner does best with a different intervention. We focused on constructing a decision tree that discriminated difference between tutoring interventions, and thus to make customization for each student. We evaluated our model on simulated and on real data. In the simulated data set, it outperformed other methods and the constructed models captured a pre-defined customization structure. With the real data, the customized learning approach achieved stronger learning gains than simply picking the best overall teaching option. Surprisingly, it was difficult to outperform a decision tree that simply used how quickly students tended to learn a skill. That is, more features and more complex models did not result in a more effective system. © 2017 ACM.",,,,,,100,One decision tree is enough to make customization,Wan H.; Beck J.E.,"Wan, Hao (55734526400); Beck, Joseph E.

"Pass the Idea Please: The Relationship between Network Position, Direct Engagement, and Course Performance in MOOCs",2017,WIP,Work in Progress,"Extant research suggests that learner engagement in discussion forums is positively correlated with learner performance. In this paper we investigate which types of forum engagement are most strongly associated with final performance in MOOC courses. In particular, we compare the correlation between course final grade and two types of learner engagement: direct measures, which count the number of interactions, and indirect measures, which capture learners position in a social network. We found that direct measures have stronger correlations with final grade.

Preventing Keystroke Based Identification in Open Data Sets,2017,Full Paper,Integrity of Courses and Learners,"Large-scale courses such as Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs) can be a great data source for researchers. Ideally, the data gathered on such courses should be openly available to all researchers. Studies could be easily replicated and novel studies on existing data could be conducted. However, very fine-grained data such as source code snapshots can contain hidden identifiers. For example, distinct typing patterns that identify individuals can be extracted from such data. Hence, simply removing explicit identifiers such as names and student numbers is not sufficient to protect the privacy of the users who have supplied the data. At the same time, removing all keystroke information would decrease the value of the shared data significantly. In this work, we study how keystroke data from a programming context could be modified to prevent keystroke latency based identification whilst still retaining information that can be used to e.g. infer programming experience. We investigate the degree of anonymization required to render identification of students based on their typing patterns unreliable. Then, we study whether the modified keystroke data can still be used to infer the programming experience of the students as a case study of whether the anonymized typing patterns have retained at least some informative value. We show that it is possible to modify data so that keystroke latency based identification is no longer accurate, but the programming experience of the students can still be inferred, i.e. the data still has value to researchers. In a broader context, our results indicate that information and anonymity are not necessarily mutually exclusive. © 2017 ACM.",,,,,,100,Preventing keystroke based identification in open data sets,Leinonen J.; Ihantola P.; Hellas A.,"Leinonen, Juho (57156123300); Ihantola, Petri (14019704700); Hellas, Arto (57192188480)",57156123300; 14019704700; 57192188480,Preventing keystroke based identification in open data sets,2017.0,L@S 2017 - Proceedings of the 4th (2017) ACM Conference on Learning at Scale,,,,101,109,8.0,6.0,10.1145/3051457.3051458,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018432742&doi=10.1145%2f3051457.3051458&partnerID=40&md5=e91cb7cb56d8531abcc97dbc99f05867,"Department of Computer Science, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland; Department of Pervasive Computing, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland","Leinonen J., Department of Computer Science, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland; Ihantola P., Department of Pervasive Computing, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland; Hellas A., Department of Computer Science, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland",Data anonymization; Data privacy; Keystroke dynamics; Programming experience inference; Source code snapshots,Computer programming; Education; Students; Anonymization; Data anonymization; Fine grained; Keystroke dynamics; Large-scale course; Programming experience; Source codes; Student numbers; Data privacy,,,,,,,"Al-Zubidy A., Carver J.C., Heckman S., Sherriff M., A (updated) review of empiricism at the SIGCSE technical symposium, Proceedings of the 47th ACM Technical Symposium on Computing Science Education, pp. 120-125, (2016); Bixler R., D'Mello S., Detecting boredom and engagement during writing with keystroke analysis, task appraisals, and stable traits, Proc. of the 2013 International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces (IUI '13), pp. 225-234, (2013); Christopher N., Brown C., Kolling M., McCall D., Utting I., Blackbox: A large scale repository of novice programmers' activity, Proc. of the 45th ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education, pp. 223-228, (2014); Coursera Signature Track, (2016); Daries J.P., Reich J., Waldo J., Young E.M., Whittinghill J., Ho A.D., Seaton D.T., Chuang I., Privacy, anonymity, and big data in the social sciences, Commun.

In this paper, we present ProjectLens, a MOOC supplement tool that supports team projects building and collaborative learning on MOOC platforms like Coursera and edX. In addition, ProjectLens is a research tool that provides opportunities to conduct large-scale field experiments to study how different factors influence the effectiveness of collaborative learning.

Robust Evaluation Matrix: Towards a More Principled Offline Exploration of Instructional Policies,2017,Full Paper,Engineering Learning Environments,"The gold standard for identifying more effective pedagogical approaches is to perform an experiment. Unfortunately, frequently a hypothesized alternate way of teaching does not yield an improved effect. Given the expense and logistics of each experiment, and the enormous space of potential ways to improve teaching, it would be highly preferable if it were possible to estimate in advance of running a study whether an alternative teaching strategy would improve learning. This is true even in learning at scale situations, since even if it is logistically easier to recruit a large number of subjects, it remains a high stakes environment because the experiment is impacting many real students. For certain classes of alternate teaching approaches, such as new ways to sequence existing material, it is possible to build student models that can be used as simulators to estimate the performance of learners under new proposed teaching methods. However, existing methods for doing so can overestimate the performance of new teaching methods. We instead propose the Robust Evaluation Matrix (REM) method which explicitly considers model mismatch between the student model used to derive the teaching strategy and that used as a simulator to evaluate the teaching strategy effectiveness. We then present two case studies from a fractions intelligent tutoring system and from a concept learning task from prior work that show how REM could be used both to detect when a new instructional policy may not be effective on actual students and to detect when it may be effective in improving student learning. © 2017 ACM.",,,,,,99,Robust evaluation matrix towards a more principled offline exploration of instructional policies,Doroudi S.; Aleven V.; Brunskill E.,"Doroudi, Shayan (57190766981); Aleven, Vincent (6602528401); Brunskill, Emma (15762040900)",57190766981; 6602528401; 15762040900,Robust evaluation matrix towards a more principled offline exploration of instructional policies,2017.0,L@S 2017 - Proceedings of the 4th (2017) ACM Conference on Learning at Scale,,,,3,12,9.0,18.0,10.1145/3051457.3051463,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018396800&doi=10.1145%2f3051457.3051463&partnerID=40&md5=ace7ca0761f73ec5032e0f6cde194690,"Computer Science Department, Carnegie Mellon University, United States; Human-Computer Interaction Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, United States","Doroudi S., Computer Science Department, Carnegie Mellon University, United States; Aleven V., Human-Computer Interaction Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, United States; Brunskill E., Computer Science Department, Carnegie Mellon University, United States",Instructional policies; Off-policy; Policy estimation; Policy selection; Reinforcement learning,Computer aided instruction; Education computing; Reinforcement learning; Students; Evaluation matrices; Intelligent tutoring system; Pedagogical approach; Policy selection; Student learning; Teaching approaches; Teaching methods; Teaching strategy; Teaching,,,,,"U.S. Dept. of Education; U.S. Department of Education, (R305A130215, R305B150008); Institute of Education Sciences; Carnegie Mellon University","The research reported here was supported, in whole or in part, by the Institute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education, through Grants R305A130215 and R305B150008 to Carnegie Mellon University.

Scaling Expert Feedback: Two Case Studies,2017,Full Paper,Feedback for Improving Learning,"Traditionally, education relies on a linear relationship between enrollment and staff; rising enrollment dictates increases to staff with some expertise (such as teaching assistants, TAs) for evaluation. This relationship is expensive, so learning at scale has largely deemphasized expert evaluation and feedback. Two organizations, though, have used different models to scale up class size online while retaining this expert evaluation and feedback. In this paper, we analyze the methods these two organizations have used to increase enrollment while preserving scalability and feedback. We observe an academic program has scaled feedback with traditional TAs by relying on unique characteristics of its student body, while a commercial program has done so with a novel, networkbased model. These successes show the potential of learning from experts at scale. © 2017 ACM.",,,,,,100,Scaling expert feedback: Two case studies,Joyner D.A.,"Joyner, David A.

Taking Informed Action on Student Activity in MOOCs,2017,WIP,Work in Progress,"This paper presents a novel approach to understand specific student behavior in MOOCs. Instructors currently perceive participants only as one homogeneous group. In order to improve learning outcomes, they encourage students to get active in the discussion forum and remind them of approaching deadlines. While these actions are most likely helpful, their actual impact is often not measured. Additionally, it is uncertain whether such generic approaches sometimes cause the opposite effect, as some participants are bothered with irrelevant information. On the basis of fine granular events emitted by our learning platform, we derive metrics and enable teachers to employ clustering, in order to divide the vast field of participants into meaningful subgroups to be addressed individually. © 2017 ACM.",,,,,,100,Taking informed action on student activity in MOOCs,Teusner R.; Rollmann K.-A.; Renz J.,"Teusner, Ralf (55810128500); Rollmann, Kai-Adrian (56159595800); Renz, Jan (56236876600)",55810128500; 56159595800; 56236876600,Taking informed action on student activity in MOOCs,2017.0,L@S 2017 - Proceedings of the 4th (2017) ACM Conference on Learning at Scale,,,,149,152,3.0,6.0,10.1145/3051457.3053971,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018368986&doi=10.1145%2f3051457.3053971&partnerID=40&md5=bef3f0f706431d5eb895eaff1b946124,"Hasso Plattner Institute, Potsdam, Germany","Teusner R., Hasso Plattner Institute, Potsdam, Germany; Rollmann K.-A., Hasso Plattner Institute, Potsdam, Germany; Renz J., Hasso Plattner Institute, Potsdam, Germany",Cluster; Learning analytics; Metrics; MOOC; Survey,Surveying; Teaching; Cluster; Homogeneous group; Learning analytics; Learning outcome; Learning platform; Metrics; MOOC; Student behavior; Students,,,,,,,"Beaudoin M.F., Learning or lurking?: Tracking the ""invisible"" online student, The Internet and Higher Education, 5, 2, pp. 147-155, (2002); Coffrin C., Corrin L., Barba P.D., Kennedy G., Visualizing patterns of student engagement and performance in MOOCs, Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Learning Analytics and Knowledge, pp. 83-92, (2014); Blanco A.D., Serrano A., Freire M., Martinez-Ortiz I., Fernandez-Manjon B., E-Learning standards and learning analytics.

Teaching Students to Recognize and Implement Good Coding Style,2017,Full Paper,Learn to Code,"Teaching students to write code with good style is important but difficult: in-depth feedback currently requires a human. AutoStyle, a style tutor that scales, offers adaptive, real-Time holistic style feedback and hints as students improve their code. An in-situ study with 103 undergraduate students in a CS class compared AutoStyle to a control tutor which only offered ABC score. While students improved the style of their code in both cases, students working with AutoStyle were more likely to use an appropriate language idiom and to improve their recognition of good style.

The Changing Patterns of MOOC Discourse,2017,WIP,Work in Progress,"There is an emerging trend in higher education for the adoption of massive open online courses (MOOCs). However, despite this interest in learning at scale, there has been limited work investigating how MOOC participants have changed over time. In this study, we explore the temporal changes in MOOC learners' language and discourse characteristics. In particular, we demonstrate that there is a clear trend within a course for language in discussion forums to be of both more on-Topic and reflective of deep learning in subsequent offerings of a course.

Towards Equal Opportunities in MOOCs: Affirmation Reduces Gender & Social-Class Achievement Gaps in China,2017,Full Paper,Experimentation,"The presence of achievement gaps in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) implies that not everyone who can gain access to a course shares the same opportunities to succeed. This study advances research on a social psychological barrier to achievement that exists alongside important structural barriers (e.g., Internet access, insufficient prior knowledge). Learners who experience social identity threat (SIT)-A fear of being judged negatively in light of a social group they identify with-Are at risk of underperforming. An initial survey identified lower-class men as an at-risk group in an English language learning MOOC for Chinese learners (N = 1,664). In a subsequent randomized experiment, an interdependent value relevance affirmation intervention raised grades, persistence, and completion rates exclusively among lower-class men-The lowest performing group in the course (N = 1,990). Efforts to establish equal opportunities in online learning should go beyond initiatives that increase access through technology to incorporate strategies that lower psychological barriers to create safe and inclusive learning environments. © 2017 ACM.",,,,,,100,Towards equal opportunities in MOOCs: Affirmation reduces gender & social-class achievement gaps in China,Kizilcec R.F.; Davis G.M.; Cohen G.L.,"Kizilcec, René F.

Using Student Annotated Hashtags and Emojis to Collect Nuanced Affective States,2017,WIP,Work in Progress,"Determining affective states such as confusion from students' participation in online discussion forums can be useful for instructors of a large classroom. However, manual annotation of forum posts by instructors or paid crowd workers is both time-consuming and expensive. In this work, we harness affordances prevalent in social media to allow students to self-Annotate their discussion posts with a set of hashtags and emojis, a process that is fast and cheap. For students, selfannotation with hashtags and emojis provides another channel for self-expression, as well as a way to signal to instructors and other students on the lookout for certain types of messages. This method also provides an easy way to acquire a labeled dataset of affective states, allowing us distinguish between more nuanced emotions such as confusion and curiosity. From a dataset of over 25,000 discussion posts from two courses containing self-Annotated posts by students, we demonstrate how we can identify linguistic differences between posts expressing confusion versus curiosity, achieving 83% accuracy at distinguishing between the two affective states. © 2017 ACM.",,,,,,100,Using student annotated hashtags and emojis to collect nuanced affective states,Zhang A.X.; Igo M.; Facciotti M.; Karger D.,"Zhang, Amy X.

What are the Expectations of Disabled Learners when Participating in a MOOC?  225-228,2017,WIP,Work in Progress,"Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs) are making low cost learning opportunities available at large scale to diverse groups of learners. For that reason, MOOCs need to be accessible so that they can offer flexibility of learning and benefits to all. In order to direct efforts towards developing accessible MOOCs, it is important to understand the current expectations of disabled learners. Analysis of data from MOOC surveys that support disclosure of disability provide quantitative information such as the proportions participating in MOOCs; their reasons for participating, and the types of MOOCs they prefer. This paper presents analysis of pre-And post-study survey data from eight MOOCs offered by the UK's Open University on the FutureLearn platform.

Writing Reusable Code Feedback at Scale with Mixed-Initiative Program Synthesis,2017,Full Paper,Feedback for Improving Learning,"In large introductory programming classes, teacher feedback on individual incorrect student submissions is often infeasible. Program synthesis techniques are capable of fixing student bugs and generating hints automatically, but they lack the deep domain knowledge of a teacher and can generate functionally correct but stylistically poor fixes. We introduce a mixedinitiative approach which combines teacher expertise with data-driven program synthesis techniques. We demonstrate our novel approach in two systems that use different interaction mechanisms. Our systems use program synthesis to learn bug-fixing code transformations and then cluster incorrect submissions by the transformations that correct them. The MISTAKEBROWSER system learns transformations from examples of students fixing bugs in their own submissions. The FIXPROPAGATOR system learns transformations from teachers fixing bugs in incorrect student submissions. Teachers can write feedback about a single submission or a cluster of submissions and propagate the feedback to all other submissions that can be fixed by the same transformation. Two studies suggest this approach helps teachers better understand student bugs and write reusable feedback that scales to a massive introductory programming classroom. © 2017 ACM.",,,,,,100,Writing reusable code feedback at scale with mixed-initiative program synthesis,Head A.;

(A)I Will Teach You to Play Gomoku: Exploring the Use of Game AI to Teach People,2022,WIP,Work in Progress,"Artificial intelligence systems such as AlphaGo, AlphaGo Zero and AlphaZero, have demonstrated their advantages and competency over human players. However, little research has explored the possibility of applying such algorithms for educational purposes, such as teaching people to play strategy games. To investigate this gap, we designed and developed a Gomoku tutor that can provide instant/delayed feedback to users. We trained an expert model for Gomoku from scratch by using an open-source AlphaZero implementation and embedded this model into our Gomoku tutoring system. We plan to use this tutor to investigate two main research questions: 1) Can Game AI models, which are inhuman in their expertise, provide guidance that improves human learning? 2) How do different types of Game AI derived feedback affect people's learning outcomes? In this paper, we outline our experimental plans to investigate these questions. © 2022 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,(A)I Will Teach You to Play Gomoku: Exploring the Use of Game AI to Teach People,Zhang Q.; MacLellan C.J.,"Zhang, Qiao (58376758800); MacLellan, Christopher J.

A Blended-Learning Program for Implementing a Rigorous Machine-Learning Curriculum in High-Schools,2022,WIP,Work in Progress,"AI, and, more specifically, deep learning, is profoundly impacting our industries and societies [1]. In recent years, machine learning (ML) 's surging impact has sparked discourse about the importance of AI education for young people, and in recent years, several initiatives and projects pursuing the mission of K-12 AI education have emerged. In 2020 Israel's Ministry of Education (MoE) approved a new comprehensive and rigorous ML curriculum targeting 11 and 12th-grade pupils majoring in computer science (CS). The curriculum is meant to be taught by the existing CS teacher workforce. However, since ML theory and practice are fundamentally different from traditional CS [2], implementing this thorough ML curriculum poses substantial challenges in developing an effective teaching workforce to deliver it. In this research, we suggest a solution for this challenge in the form of a blended-learning (BL) program. The online component of this program is based mainly on Coursera's Deep Learning Specialization MOOCs series [3]. The BL program, enhanced with pedagogical training, is also used for the professional development (PD) of the teachers who deliver the program. Out of fourteen CS teachers who participated in the PD in the summer of 2021, ten teach the BL program this year to 273 high-school pupils. Initial results demonstrate the achievement of the curriculum learning goals and provide compelling preliminary evidence that this program enables CS teachers who are new to machine learning to teach this thorough curriculum effectively © 2022 ACM.",,,,,,100,A Blended-Learning Program for Implementing a Rigorous Machine-Learning Curriculum in High-Schools,Perach S.; Alexandron G.,"Perach, Shai (57748640700); Alexandron, Giora (8945106100)",57748640700; 8945106100,A Blended-Learning Program for Implementing a Rigorous Machine-Learning Curriculum in High-Schools,2022.0,L@S 2022 - Proceedings of the 9th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,267,270,3.0,2.0,10.1145/3491140.3528291,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132135027&doi=10.1145%2f3491140.3528291&partnerID=40&md5=a88b2a4e8602505cba273fb5961ecc12,"Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel","Perach S., Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel; Alexandron G., Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel",artificial intelligence education; blended-learning; computer science education; data science education; K-12 AI education; machine learning education; MOOCs,Deep learning; Education computing; Learning systems; Personnel training; Artificial intelligence education; Blended learning; Computer Science Education; Data science education; K-12 AI education; Learning projects; Machine learning education; Machine-learning; MOOC; Science education; Curricula,,,,,,,"Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2021, (2021); Shapiro B., Fiebrink R., Norvig P., Education: How machine learning impacts the undergraduate computing curriculum, Communications of the ACM, 61, 11, pp. 27-29, (2018); Ng A., Deep Learning by deeplearning. ai | Coursera, (2017); Perach S., Alexandron G., A MOOC-Based Computer Science Program for Middle School Results, Challenges, and the Covid-19 Effect, pp. 111-127, (2021); Ng A., Machine Learning by Stanford University | Coursera, (2011); Ng A., Widom J., Origins of the modern MOOC (xMOOC), pp. 34-47, (2014); Shah D., Capturing the Hype: Year of the MOOC Timeline Explained, Class Central, (2020); The 50 Most Popular MOOCs of All Time (Updated For 2021)-Online Course Report, (2021); Khandelwal P., Top Machine Learning MOOCs and Online Lectures: A Comprehensive Survey-KDnuggets, KD nuggets, (2016); Neo B., Top 20 free Data Science, ML and AI MOOCs on the Internet. | by Benedict Neo | Towards Data Science, Towards Data Science, (2020); Costa C.D., Top 10 MOOCs for Learning Data Science and Machine Learning, (2020); Garrison D.R., Anderson T., Archer W., Critical Inquiry in a Text-Based Environment: Computer Conferencing in Higher Education, The Internet and Higher Education, 2, 2, pp. 87-105, (1999); Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) | Coursera.",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",ACM Ed Board,"9th Annual ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2022",1 June 2022 through 3 June 2022,New York City,179832.0,,978-145039158-0,,,English,LS - Proc.

A Study about Future Prospects of JupyterHub in MOOCs,2022,WIP,Work in Progress,"The Hasso Plattner Institute (HPI) has been successfully delivering courses on several MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) platforms for the last 10 years, offering courses on various topics in the context of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Data Science. In recent years, Jupyter Notebooks have become one of the most widely used tools for data science applications, a platform for learning and practicing various programming languages. We want to integrate JupyterHub into our learning platform in order to provide students with hands-on experience in AI. We have conducted a survey with a series of research questions in order to understand the needs of instructors in their courses at different institutions. In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of our survey results and we discuss our future approach to using JupyterHub as an infrastructure to solve hands-on programming exercises on our platform. We propose the idea of creating a tool to automate server and environment creation for students to work on. This tool would give instructors a platform to operate from and allow them to customize their courses. Moreover, it would help them automate assignment submissions, grading, and provide feedback to their students. © 2022 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,A Study about Future Prospects of JupyterHub in MOOCs,Elhayany M.; Nair R.-R.; Staubitz T.; Meinel C.,"Elhayany, Mohamed (57747327800); Nair, Ranjiraj-Rajendran (57746999400); Staubitz, Thomas (56237871000); Meinel, Christoph (56187776800)",57747327800; 57746999400; 56237871000; 56187776800,A Study about Future Prospects of JupyterHub in MOOCs,2022.0,L@S 2022 - Proceedings of the 9th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,275,279,4.0,1.0,10.1145/3491140.3529537,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132183375&doi=10.1145%2f3491140.3529537&partnerID=40&md5=a6adbc7bb0ab8c7174331575316df979,"Hasso-Plattner Institute, Potsdam, Germany; Otto von Guericke University, Magdeburg, Germany","Elhayany M., Hasso-Plattner Institute, Potsdam, Germany; Nair R.-R., Otto von Guericke University, Magdeburg, Germany; Staubitz T., Hasso-Plattner Institute, Potsdam, Germany; Meinel C., Hasso-Plattner Institute, Potsdam, Germany",automated grading; Jupyterhub; MOOC; programming; scheduling,Artificial intelligence; Data Science; Grading; Surveys; Automated grading; Future prospects; Jupyterhub; Learning platform; Machine data; Machine-learning; Massive open online course; Platform for learning; Programming; Science applications; Students,,,,,,,"Brunner R.J., Kim E.J., Teaching data science, In ICCS 2016, The International Conference on Computational Science.

Adding a Demographic Lens to Cluster Analysis of Participants in Entry-level Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs),2022,WIP,Work in Progress,"This paper provides insight into how underrepresented learners are engaging with entry-level MOOCs, leveraging cluster analysis [19] on previously unexamined data from entry-level MOOCs produced by a major research university in the United States (USA) [29]. From an initial sample of more than 260,000 learners, a subset of data from more than 29,000 participants who submitted an assignment for a grade in one of nine entry-level MOOCs is analysed. Manhattan Distance [37, 27] and Gower Distance [5, 11] measures are computed based on engagement and achievement data, and clusters are derived from application of the CLARA and PAM algorithms [35]. The clusters are enriched by demographic data, with a particular focus on education level, as well as by approximated socioeconomic status derived from the American Community Survey. Results indicate that, in the courses analysed, learners without a college degree are more likely to be high-performing compared to college-educated learners; additionally, learners from approximated lower socioeconomic backgrounds are no less likely to be successful than learners from approximated middle and higher socioeconomic backgrounds in the USA.

Advancing the Democratization of Research: Citizen Science,2022,WIP,Work in Progress,We outline the features of an initiative to improve the inclusivity and transparency of research by using methods utilized by the citizen science community to develop participation in research projects by members of the public. Our aim is to transform the prevalent approach to public participation in such projects from the limited roles of data provider or data analyst and extending roles to that of co-researcher or stakeholder. We describe our approach to citizen science inquiry and discuss how it forms the basis of our intention and plan to advance the democratization of research. A pilot project of the approach is described.

Amazon Alexa Skills as a Novel Modality for In-service Professional Micro-Development (WIP),2022,WIP,Work in Progress,"Intelligent digital assistants, such as products like Amazon's Alexa, are becoming more prolific and available as time progresses. This work reports on the process of developing applications, refered to by Alexa as 'skills,' to support in-service professional development for teachers. The precedent of allowing Alexa to be utilized within the classroom, but not necessarily for teachers' skill development, is explored to contextualize the application of the technology as a professional development modality. Across the entire content development spectrum - spanning script writing to deployment and release - lessons are presented from experience to assist future teams embarking on the process in the hopes they are able to avoid repeating the problems encountered by this research team. Finally, a general discussion relating to the future of intelligent digital assistants and their applications to professional development is presented with the intent of provoking discussion and setting the stage for more rigorous investigations into the usability, efficacy, and results of this technology. © 2022 ACM.",,,,,,100,Amazon Alexa Skills as a Novel Modality for In-service Professional Micro-Development (WIP),Robins A.; Hunt T.; Robertson D.; Carter R.,"Robins, Andey (57747321600); Hunt, Tiffany (57213149571); Robertson, Dana (55875818700); Carter, Richard (56893094500)",57747321600; 57213149571; 55875818700; 56893094500,Amazon Alexa Skills as a Novel Modality for In-service Professional Micro-Development (WIP),2022.0,L@S 2022 - Proceedings of the 9th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,284,288,4.0,0.0,10.1145/3491140.3528314,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132179119&doi=10.1145%2f3491140.3528314&partnerID=40&md5=0750e04440353187f0faa93e296529ef,"University of Wyoming, Laramie, WY, United States; Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, United States","Robins A., University of Wyoming, Laramie, WY, United States; Hunt T., University of Wyoming, Laramie, WY, United States; Robertson D., Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, United States; Carter R., University of Wyoming, Laramie, WY, United States",amazon alexa; education; interdisciplinary engineering; professional development,Personal digital assistants; Amazon alexa; Contents development; Contextualize; Digital assistants; Interdisciplinary engineering; Professional development; Professional development for teachers; Skills development; Teachers'; Time progress; Professional aspects,,,,,,,"Borowczak M., Burrows A.C., Ants Go Marching-Integrating Computer Science into Teacher Professional Development with NetLogo, Education Sciences, 9, 1, (2019); Daley S., Pennington J., Alexa the Teacher's Pet?

An Examination of Unofficial Course Reviews in a Graduate Program at Scale,2022,WIP,Work in Progress,"Past research on the ways that students evaluate their courses has focused largely on how those evaluations relate to the specific course instructor. This research examines a set of data from a public site where students unofficially rate the courses in a very large online graduate program operating at scale. We examine the relationship between the unofficial scores students give to their classes with data on enrollment trends over time and the assessment strategies used within the courses themselves to examine additional actors that shape the ratings students choose, as well as how they use those ratings to choose what courses to take in the future. We find several different notable relationships: reviews in this context are largely impervious to the extreme response bias prevalent on other review sites; review content does not appear to significantly influence enrollment trends; more difficult classes tend to receive more favorable ratings overall, although individual students do not rate difficult classes more favorably; and project-based classes are perceived by students to be less difficult. © 2022 ACM.",,,,,,100,An Examination of Unofficial Course Reviews in a Graduate Program at Scale,Eicher B.L.; Joyner D.A.,"Eicher, Bobbie L.

"Analysis of the Applicability of General Scaling Laws on Course Size, Completion Rates, and Forum Activity in MOOCs",2022,WIP,Work in Progress,"In 2017, Geoffrey West published his book ""Scale""in which he examined universal laws of scale in different contexts. Inspired by his keynote in 2021's Learning@Scale conference, we investigated the applicability of these laws in the context of Massive Open Online Courses and learners' behavior. We tested these laws on different learning platforms from academic, enterprise and social, and research contexts. In this paper, we examine course characteristics, such as course size, the completion rate, and the forum activity.

BlockLens: Visual Analytics of Student Coding Behaviors in Block-Based Programming Environments,2022,WIP,Work in Progress,"Block-based programming environments have been widely used to introduce K-12 students to coding. To guide students effectively, instructors and platform owners often need to understand behaviors like how students solve certain questions or where they get stuck and why. However, it is challenging for them to effectively analyze students' coding data. To this end, we propose BlockLens, a novel visual analytics system to assist instructors and platform owners in analyzing students' block-based coding behaviors, mistakes, and problem-solving patterns. BlockLens enables the grouping of students by question progress and performance, identification of common problem-solving strategies and pitfalls, and presentation of insights at multiple granularity levels, from a high-level overview of all students to a detailed analysis of one student's behavior and performance. A usage scenario using real-world data demonstrates the usefulness of BlockLens in facilitating the analysis of K-12 students' programming behaviors. © 2022 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,BlockLens: Visual Analytics of Student Coding Behaviors in Block-Based Programming Environments,Tsung S.;

Challenges of Scaling Programming-based Behavioral Metrics,2022,WIP,Work in Progress,"Small previous studies exploring student programming process have demonstrated behavioral metrics' (i.e., EQ, Watwin, RED) ability to predict grades. However, this relationship deteriorates when scaled across contexts [1]. This paper replicates Price et al's finding on anonymized data collected from thousands of learners across the globe that use the Codio platform and discusses the context-dependent nature of these behavioral metrics and grades noted in previous work as potential reasons for this finding. We predicted that these metrics would be more consistent across programming assignments than grades. However, we found that behavioral metrics vary more, possibly an artifact of students struggling before achieving success - a pattern not captured by grades. This shows the promise of these metrics and their ability to act as a real-time indicator of student process instead of a predictor of grade performance. © 2022 ACM.",,,,,,100,Challenges of Scaling Programming-based Behavioral Metrics,Chandarana M.; Deitrick E.,"Chandarana, Mohit (57747985900); Deitrick, Elise (56736849000)",57747985900; 56736849000,Challenges of Scaling Programming-based Behavioral Metrics,2022.0,L@S 2022 - Proceedings of the 9th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,304,308,4.0,0.0,10.1145/3491140.3528290,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132164773&doi=10.1145%2f3491140.3528290&partnerID=40&md5=7213564488e00ae17d731e11890782db,"Codio, Cambridge, MA, United States","Chandarana M., Codio, Cambridge, MA, United States; Deitrick E., Codio, Cambridge, MA, United States",behavioral metrics; compiler errors; EQ; learning analytics; RED; Watwin score,Behavioral research; Computer programming; Program compilers; Behavioral metric; Compiler error; Context dependent; EQ; Learning analytic; Programming assignments; Programming process; RED; Scalings; Watwin score; Students,,,,,,,"Price T.W., Hovemeyer D., Rivers K., Gao G., Cory Bart A., Kazerouni A.M., Becker B.A., Petersen A., Gusukuma L., Edwards S.H., Babcock D., ProgSnap2: A Flexible Format for Programming Process Data, Proceedings of the 2020 ACM Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education (ITiCSE '20), pp. 356-362, (2020); Jadud M.C., Methods and tools for exploring novice compilation behavior, Proceedings of the second international workshop on Computing education research (ICER '06), pp. 73-84, (2006); Watson C., Li B.F.W., Godwin J.L., Predicting Performance in an Introductory Programming Course by Logging and Analyzing Student Programming Behavior, 2013 IEEE 13th International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies, pp. 319-323, (2013); Carter A.S., Hundhausen C.D., Adesope O., The Normalized Programming State Model: Predicting Student Performance in Computing Courses Based on Programming Behavior, Proceedings of the eleventh annual International Conference on International Computing Education Research (ICER '15), pp. 141-150, (2015); Becker B.A., A New Metric to Quantify Repeated Compiler Errors for Novice Programmers, Proceedings of the 2016 ACM Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education (ITiCSE '16), pp. 296-301, (2016); Petersen A., Spacco J., Vihavainen A., An exploration of error quotient in multiple contexts, Proceedings of the 15th Koli Calling Conference on Computing Education Research (Koli Calling '15), pp. 77-86, (2015); Jadud M.C., Dorn B., Aggregate Compilation Behavior: Findings and Implications from 27, 698 Users, Proceedings of the eleventh annual International Conference on International Computing Education Research (ICER '15), pp. 131-139, (2015); Frantzeskou G., Stamatatos E., Gritzalis S., Katsikas S., Effective identification of source code authors using byte-level information, Proceedings of the 28th international conference on Software engineering (ICSE '06), pp. 893-896, (2006); Abuhamad M., AbuHmed T., Mohaisen A., Nyang D., Large-Scale and Language-Oblivious, Code Authorship Identification, 2018 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS '18), (2018); Richardson M., Abraham C., Bond R., Psychological correlates of university students' academic performance: A systematic review and metaanalysis, Psychological Bulletin, 138, 2, pp. 353-387, (2012); Kappe R., Van Der Flier H., Predicting academic success in higher education: What's more important than being smart, European Journal of Psychology of Education, 27, 4, pp. 605-619, (2012)",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",ACM Ed Board,"9th Annual ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2022",1 June 2022 through 3 June 2022,New York City,179832.0,,978-145039158-0,,,English,LS - Proc.

Collaboration at Scale: Exploring Member Role Changing Patterns in Collaborative Science Problem-solving Tasks,2022,WIP,Work in Progress,"Our work-in-progress paper explores students' role-changing patterns while working on science tasks in small groups. Grounded on the Collaboration Conceptual Model, we examined how members in 15 middle school student groups changed their roles throughout the entire collaborative activities. We annotated students' role changes at a one-minute segment, as well as the overall group collaboration quality at the individual task level for each student group. Our analytical approach involved hierarchical cluster analysis and non-parametric statistical tests to identify the relationships between students' role-changing patterns and collaboration outcomes. Preliminary results identified two distinct group types that showed different patterns of role changes and manifested different group collaboration qualities and performances.

Collaborative Annotation: Links to Formative Assessment and Issues of Scale for Pedagogy,2022,WIP,Work in Progress,"Annotations on text have been made to spark thoughts, add nuance, and facilitate reading since the inception of printed text itself. Newly emerging collaborative online annotation platforms, such as hypothes.is and Perusall, are enabling annotation of webpages and digital documents on a scale never before seen, serving students in very large numbers. Hypothes.is also seems poised to positively disrupt the peer and post-publication peer review process. Previous review articles have done an excellent job critically analyzing annotation for those in higher education, and predicting the future, but pedagogical issues based on the number of annotators, amount of annotation, and public access for a document have not received much attention. Collaborative annotation also has some natural connections to the formative assessment field, which have not been sufficiently explored in the past. This brief review will examine how the number of annotators, an issue of scale, can hinder or benefit learners, and how annotation can embody a formative assessment practice. The educational technology and assessment fields have much to gain by investigating the routines surrounding dynamically annotated text. © 2022 ACM.",,,,,,100,Collaborative Annotation: Links to Formative Assessment and Issues of Scale for Pedagogy,Porter G.,"Porter, Gavin (8986671900)",8986671900,Collaborative Annotation: Links to Formative Assessment and Issues of Scale for Pedagogy,2022.0,L@S 2022 - Proceedings of the 9th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,313,316,3.0,1.0,10.1145/3491140.3528322,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132188463&doi=10.1145%2f3491140.3528322&partnerID=40&md5=205cbd19b99d2b725c3e5e42eb3c07bb,"Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States","Porter G., Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States",annotation; assessment; asynchronous; feedback; formative; hypothes.is; peer learning; perusall,Annotation; Assessment; Asynchronoi; Be; Formative; Formative assessment; Hypothes.; Peer learning; Perusall; Printed texts,,,,,,,"Andreessen M., Why Andreessen Horowitz Is Investing in Rap Genius, (2014); Carless D., Feedback as dialogue, Encycl.

Comparing MOOC Learners Engagement with Japanese Videos and Text to Speech Generated English Videos,2022,WIP,Work in Progress,"In recent years, massive open online courses (MOOCs) have been rapidly growing with learners from both English and non-English speaking countries. Nowadays, many MOOC developers provide transcripts in multiple languages to attract a broader range of learners. However, providing transcripts is ineffective for visually impaired learners and tends to divert learners' attention away from the overall content of the video lecture. Thus, aside from offering English transcripts, Japanese lecture videos in the Tokyo TechIntroduction to Electrical and Electronic Engineering MOOC were automatically dubbed into English with a computer-generated voice. To understand the effect of English-automatically dubbed videos on learners, the learners' interactions, video completion rate, and course completions were compared to the original course in Japanese. The results show that English automatically dubbed videos have an overall high learner engagement when compared to Japanese videos with English transcripts. Survey results on learners' satisfaction towards the English dubbed videos also showed higher positive responses. These results show the effectiveness of dubbing Japanese lectures into English using text-to-speech technology which has signification for MOOCs offered in various languages. © 2022 ACM.",,,,,,100,Comparing MOOC Learners Engagement with Japanese Videos and Text to Speech Generated English Videos,Boonyubol S.; Kabir S.; Cross J.S.,"Boonyubol, Sasipa (57219667773); Kabir, Shahriar (57747667300); Cross, Jeffrey Scott (7402349007)",57219667773; 57747667300; 7402349007,Comparing MOOC Learners Engagement with Japanese Videos and Text to Speech Generated English Videos,2022.0,L@S 2022 - Proceedings of the 9th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,317,320,3.0,1.0,10.1145/3491140.3528302,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132208553&doi=10.1145%2f3491140.3528302&partnerID=40&md5=c653ef8a6772675f391c0b962aa78d08,"Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan","Boonyubol S., Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan; Kabir S., Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan; Cross J.S., Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan",automatic dubbing; course completion; learner satisfaction; massive open online courses; retention rate; text-to-speech,E-learning; Automatic dubbings; Course completion; Learner satisfaction; Lecture video; Massive open online course; Multiple languages; Retention rate; Text to speech; Video lectures; Visually impaired; Surveys,,,,,,,"Boonyubol S., Ngoc Khanh D., Nagahama T., Cross J.S., W-04 Improving International Learners' Engagement in Japanese Online Engineering Courses by Adding Automatically English Dubbed Videos, JSEE Annual Conference International Session Proceedings 2021, pp. 18-23, (2021); Che X., Luo S., Yang H., Meinel C., Automatic Lecture Subtitle Generation and How It Helps, 2017 IEEE 17th International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies (ICALT), pp. 34-38, (2017); Federico M., Enyedi R., Barra-Chicote R., Giri R., Isik U., Krishnaswamy A., Sawaf H., From Speechto-Speech Translation to Automatic Dubbing, (2020); Hone K.S., Said El G.R., Exploring the factors affecting MOOC retention: A survey study, Computers & Education, 98, pp. 157-168, (2016); Kristine Jonson Carlon M., Anie Day Asa D.C., Keerativoranan N., Nagahama T., Cross J.S., Topic Modeling in MOOCs: What Was to Be Discussed, What the Instructor Discussed, and What the Learners Discussed, 2021 IEEE International Conference on Engineering, Technology Education (TALE), pp. 849-853, (2021); edX Introduction to Electrical and Electronic Engineering MOOC, (2021); Perego E., Orrego Carmona D., Bottiroli S., An empirical take on the dubbing vs. subtitling debate: An eye movement study, (2016); Sha D., By the numbers: Moocs in 2021-class central, (2021)",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",ACM Ed Board,"9th Annual ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2022",1 June 2022 through 3 June 2022,New York City,179832.0,,978-145039158-0,,,English,LS - Proc.

Developing Student's Global Competencies at Scale in an Affordable MOOC K12 Outreach Initiative,2022,WIP,Work in Progress,"Global education for cultivating global citizens is an essential educational topic for communities today. However, the standardized public curriculum has limited opportunities to cultivate K12 students to become global citizens. Currently, a MOOC outreach initiative has been launched in Hong Kong, facilitating students to access MOOCs from world-renowned universities. Students' learning is assessed by online assignments in MOOCs, and accompanied by feedback from other MOOC learners. Through learning MOOCs, students can gain global learning experiences based on their interests, and develop global competencies. In this work-in-progress paper, we will discuss how the initiative has been implemented, how the initiative has influenced students and how the initiative can influence K12 education and United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (UN SDG) Education. © 2022 ACM.",,,,,,100,Developing Student's Global Competencies at Scale in an Affordable MOOC K12 Outreach Initiative,Lei C.-U.; Wei H.Q.,"Lei, Chi-Un (18134021100); Wei, Hong Qiang (57747987700)",18134021100; 57747987700,Developing Student's Global Competencies at Scale in an Affordable MOOC K12 Outreach Initiative,2022.0,L@S 2022 - Proceedings of the 9th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,321,324,3.0,3.0,10.1145/3491140.3528307,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132155031&doi=10.1145%2f3491140.3528307&partnerID=40&md5=07e687ac43b86e52d8c178bfec7166a9,"The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong; Ccc Kei Yuen College, Hong Kong, Hong Kong","Lei C.-U., The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong; Wei H.Q., Ccc Kei Yuen College, Hong Kong, Hong Kong",global education; k12; mooc; outreach,Global education; Global learning; Hong-kong; K12; K12 outreach; Learning experiences; Mooc; Online assignments; Outreach; Student learning; Students,,,,,,,"Wiley B.L., Leading for global competence: A schoolwide approach, Leading the new literacies, pp. 123-160, (2014); Lee Colvin R., Edwards V., Teaching for Global Competence in a Rapidly Changing World, (2018); Reimers F., Educating for global competency, International perspectives on the goals of universal basic and secondary education.

Discrimination of Automatically Generated Questions Used as Formative Practice,2022,WIP,Work in Progress,"Advances in artificial intelligence and automatic question generation (AQG) have made it possible to generate the volume of formative practice questions needed to engage students in learning by doing. These automatically generated (AG) questions can be integrated with textbook content in a courseware environment so that students can practice as they read. Scaling this learn by doing method is a valuable pursuit, as it is proven to cause better learning outcomes (i.e., the doer effect). However, it is also necessary to ensure these AG questions perform equally as well as human-authored (HA) questions. In previous studies, it was found that AG and HA questions were essentially equivalent with respect to student engagement, difficulty, and persistence. While these question performance metrics expanded existing AQG research, this paper further extends this research by evaluating question discrimination using student data from a university Neuroscience course. It is found that the AG questions also perform as well as HA questions with respect to discrimination. © 2022 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,Discrimination of Automatically Generated Questions Used as Formative Practice,Johnson B.G.; Dittel J.S.; Van Campenhout R.; Jerome B.,"Johnson, Benny G.

EdTech and Girls Education in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: Which Intervention Types Have the Greatest Impact on Learning Outcomes for Girls?  330-334,2022,WIP,Work in Progress,"Gender-based inequality in access to education is an issue of global concern. The use of educational technology is often cited as a potential way to help close educational gaps and promote girls' education. However, the existing evidence base in relation to girls' learning outcomes when using educational technology in low-income countries is limited. The evidence base was recently boosted by a study in which findings from classic educational development studies were revisited and disaggregated by gender. In this paper, we present a secondary analysis of this dataset, focusing specifically on the educational technology-focused interventions, and sourcing additional data. The analysis comprises 35 interventions, reported across 15 publications, published between 2003 and 2019. We discuss the relative efficacy of different types of educational technology interventions by comparing effect sizes of learning outcomes for girls. The findings suggest that interventions which focus on distributing hardware alone have mixed - and sometimes negative - effects on learning outcomes for girls. The impact of software-focused interventions is more positive, particularly personalised learning applications. Furthermore, we consider characteristics of the studies included in the analysis, and identify gaps in the literature which will help shape research in this field in the future. © 2022 Owner/Author.",,,,,,97,EdTech and Girls Education in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: Which Intervention Types Have the Greatest Impact on Learning Outcomes for Girls?,Jordan K.; Myers C.,"Jordan, Katy (55314576400); Myers, Christina (57208408234)",55314576400; 57208408234,EdTech and Girls Education in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: Which Intervention Types Have the Greatest Impact on Learning Outcomes for Girls?,2022.0,L@S 2022 - Proceedings of the 9th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,330,334,4.0,1.0,10.1145/3491140.3528305,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132181479&doi=10.1145%2f3491140.3528305&partnerID=40&md5=1c6623152df9a724446e409b586874de,"University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom; Overseas Development Institute, London, United Kingdom","Jordan K., University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom; Myers C., Overseas Development Institute, London, United Kingdom",educational technology; equity; gender; girls education; international development; low- and middle-income countries,Application programs; Additional datum; Development study; Effect size; Equity; Gender; Girl education; International development; Learning outcome; Low income countries; Middle-income countries; Educational technology,,,,,"Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, FCDO","We are grateful to David K.

Effects of Framing Professional Development as a Career Growth Opportunity on Course Completion,2022,WIP,Work in Progress,"Professional development (PD) trainings help ensure employees keep up with important changes in practice, policy, and technology, but they are often perceived as burdensome by employees, likely contributing to compliance issues. Negative attitudes towards PD trainings may arise because employees view them as a chore rather than a benefit. We conducted a multi-faceted utility-value intervention in the context of a mandated, state-wide training program over two years. The intervention encouraged participants to see PD training as an opportunity for professional growth using messages embedded in email and on the PD website. We randomly assigned 98 employers (496 employees) to either the intervention condition or a business-as-usual control condition. We found limited evidence of the intervention increasing course completion. Qualitative findings suggest alternative interventions to address time management and structural barriers in trainings and workplaces. © 2022 ACM.",,,,,,100,Effects of Framing Professional Development as a Career Growth Opportunity on Course Completion,Kizilcec R.F.; Mimno J.A.; Karhan A.J.,"Kizilcec, René F.

Exploring the Relationships between Social and Teaching Presence in Video-based Informal Learning Using Network Analysis,2022,WIP,Work in Progress,"In this study, we explored the relationships between the categories of social presence and teaching presence within theory-oriented and application-oriented sessions of an online course on databases in Bilibili, a popular Chinese video-based social media platform. Teaching presence in video-based learning was analyzed based on the video content, and students' social presence was analyzed based on 3,456 'Danmaku', the synchronized on-screen comments posted by users while watching the teaching video in each episode. Significant differences were observed in the frequencies of co-occurrence among pairs of teaching and social presence categories when comparing theory- and application-oriented sessions, as confirmed through chi-square testing. This study contributes to the theoretical development of understanding the interactions between teaching presence and social presence in video-based online learning, and provides insights for the design of effective video-based online learning resources. © 2022 ACM.",,,,,,100,Exploring the Relationships between Social and Teaching Presence in Video-based Informal Learning Using Network Analysis,Chen X.; Feng S.,"Chen, Xiuyu (57747638500); Feng, Shihui (57190013027)",57747638500; 57190013027,Exploring the Relationships between Social and Teaching Presence in Video-based Informal Learning Using Network Analysis,2022.0,L@S 2022 - Proceedings of the 9th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,340,344,4.0,2.0,10.1145/3491140.3528316,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132178778&doi=10.1145%2f3491140.3528316&partnerID=40&md5=413bdf342f496f70a0be79e647590112,"The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong","Chen X., The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong; Feng S., The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong",community of inquiry; social network analysis; video-based learning analytics,E-learning; Social networking (online); Application-oriented; Community of inquiry; Informal learning; Online course; Social media platforms; Social Network Analysis; Social presence; Teaching presence; Video contents; Video-based learning analytic; Teaching,,,,,HKU Seed Fund for Basic Research for New Staff for new faculty,This work was partially funded by the HKU Seed Fund for Basic Research for New Staff for new faculty (SF).,"Akyol Z., Randy Garrison D., The development of a community of inquiry over time in an online course: Understanding the progression and integration of social, cognitive and teaching presence, Journal of Asynchronous Learning Networks, 12, pp. 3-22, (2008); Anderson T., Liam R., Randy Garrison D., Archer W., Assessing teaching presence in a computer conferencing context, Journal of the Asynchronous Learning Network, 5, (2001); Boston W., Diaz S.R., Gibson A.M., Ice P., Richardson J., Swan K., An exploration of the relationship between indicators of the community of inquiry framework and retention in online programs, Journal of Asynchronous Learning Networks, 13, pp. 67-83, (2009); Brugman H., Russel A., Nijmegen X., Annotating Multimedia/ Multi-modal Resources with ELAN, LREC, pp. 2065-2068, (2004); Fang J., Chen L., Wen C., Prybutok V.R., Co-viewing experience in video websites: The effect of social presence on e-loyalty, International Journal of Electronic Commerce, 22, 3, pp. 446-476, (2018); Randy Garrison D., Anderson T., Archer W., Critical inquiry in a text-based environment: Computer conferencing in higher education, The Internet and Higher Education, 2, 2-3, pp. 87-105, (1999); Randy Garrison D., Cleveland-Innes M., Shing Fung T., Exploring causal relationships among teaching, cognitive and social presence: Student perceptions of the community of inquiry framework, The Internet and Higher Education, 13, 1-2, pp. 31-36, (2010); Giannakos M.N., Jaccheri L., Krogstie J., Exploring the relationship between video lecture usage patterns and students' attitudes, British Journal of Educational Technology, 47, 6, pp. 1259-1275, (2016); Li J., The interface affect of a contact zone: Danmaku on videostreaming platforms, Asiascape: Digital Asia, 4, 3, pp. 233-256, (2017); Li Z., Li R., Jin G., Sentiment analysis of danmaku videos based on Naïve Bayes and sentiment dictionary, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 75073-75084, (2020); Pal S., Kanti Dutta Pramanik P., Majumdar T., Choudhury P., A semi-automatic metadata extraction model and method for videobased e-learning contents, Education and Information Technologies, 24, 6, pp. 3243-3268, (2019); Rourke L., Anderson T., Randy Garrison D., Archer W., Assessing social presence in asynchronous text-based computer conferencing, The Journal of Distance Education/Revue de l'ducation Distance, 14, 2, pp. 50-71, (1999); Shea P., Hayes S., Vickers J., Gozza-Cohen M., Uzuner S., Mehta R., Valchova A., Rangan P., A re-examination of the community of inquiry framework: Social network and content analysis, The Internet and Higher Education, 13, 1-2, pp. 10-21, (2010); Swan K., Garrison D.R., Richardson J.C., A constructivist approach to online learning: The community of inquiry framework, Information technology and constructivism in higher education: Progressive learning frameworks.

How COVID-19 Affected Computer Science MOOC Learner Behavior and Achievements: A Demographic Study,2022,WIP,Work in Progress,"Learner data from multiple instances of two introductory Python MOOCs, offered before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, were analyzed to see if and how learner behavior and overall learning outcomes changed during the pandemic. We found a surge in interest during the pandemic, but the certification rate fell short of the pre-pandemic average. Moreover, this drop in certification rate is more noticeable for the advanced course in the sequence, and is more pronounced in groups traditionally underrepresented in computer-science and coding communities. Additionally, we analyzed learners' interaction with one another on the course discussion forum, and performed a sentiment analysis of the forum comments using natural language processing, which revealed behavioral trends that differed significantly during the pandemic. © 2022 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,How COVID-19 Affected Computer Science MOOC Learner Behavior and Achievements: A Demographic Study,Roy A.; Yee M.; Perdue M.; Stein J.; Bell A.; Carter R.; Miyagawa S.,"Roy, Anindya (57672326500); Yee, Michael (23479017000); Perdue, Meghan (57218225588); Stein, Julius (57746675800); Bell, Ana (57215551299); Carter, Ronisha (57748618700); Miyagawa, Shigeru (7201867694)",57672326500; 23479017000; 57218225588; 57746675800; 57215551299; 57748618700; 7201867694,How COVID-19 Affected Computer Science MOOC Learner Behavior and Achievements: A Demographic Study,2022.0,L@S 2022 - Proceedings of the 9th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,345,349,4.0,7.0,10.1145/3491140.3528328,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132199178&doi=10.1145%2f3491140.3528328&partnerID=40&md5=46a0862ddb148c10df1eb6c69648b69a,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States; Mit Lincoln Laboratory, Lexington, MA, United States; DAF/MIT Ai Accelerator, Cambridge, MA, United States","Roy A., Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States; Yee M., Mit Lincoln Laboratory, Lexington, MA, United States; Perdue M., Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States; Stein J., Mit Lincoln Laboratory, Lexington, MA, United States; Bell A., Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States; Carter R., DAF/MIT Ai Accelerator, Cambridge, MA, United States; Miyagawa S., Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States",change in learning behavior and attainment; COVID-19; MOOCs; natural language processing; underrepresentation in computer science,Learning systems; Python; Sentiment analysis; Change in learning behavior and attainment; Demographic study; Language processing; Learning behavior; Learning outcome; MOOC; Multiple instances; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Underrepresentation in computer science; COVID-19,,,,,"United States Air Force Artificial Intelligence Accelerator, (FA8750-19-2-1000); United States Air Force Research Laboratory","Research was sponsored by the United States Air Force Research Laboratory and the United States Air Force Artificial Intelligence Accelerator and was accomplished under Cooperative Agreement Number FA8750-19-2-1000.

How Much and for Whom?: A Multi-Wave Study of the Impact of Self-Regulated Learning Scaffolds on MOOC Student Academic Performance,2022,WIP,Work in Progress,"With an effort to ameliorate the high dropout rates and the low performance in the massive open online courses (MOOCs), this paper presents multi-wave, experimental studies with a longitudinal intervention of self-regulated learning scaffolds on 24 MOOCs for 2650 learners. The self-regulated learning user interface (SRLUI) is designed based on Zimmerman's SRL cyclical model with a learning dashboard, interactive user interface, nudging effect. SRLUI is designed with two goals: 1. manifesting learner self-regulated learning behavior 2. enhancing learning outcomes. In this study, our primary research question is, ""What is the marginal effect of SRLUI on learning as evidenced by final course grade?""To answer the research question, we employed a multilevel Bayesian beta regression modeling approach, first to each intervention and then across all three interventions in the aggregate. Our findings were mixed. We found some evidence of enhanced learning for passing and non-passing students across some of the individual interventions. On the whole, we determined that there was no statistical evidence of positive impacts on learning for students who pass a given course, though there is evidence of a small positive impact on learning for students who did not ultimately pass a given course. We discuss potential reasons for this differential impact and its implication for future course design and research. © 2022 ACM.",,,,,,100,How Much and for Whom?

Incorporating Explainable Learning Analytics to Assist Educators with Identifying Students in Need of Attention,2022,WIP,Work in Progress,"Increased enrolments in higher education, and the shift to online learning that has been escalated by the recent COVID pandemic, have made it challenging for instructors to assist their students with their learning needs. Contributing to the growing literature on instructor-facing systems, this paper reports on the development of a learning analytics (LA) technique called Student Inspection Facilitator (SIF) that provides an explainable interpretation of students learning behaviour to support instructors with the identification of students in need of attention. Unlike many previous predictive systems that automatically label students, our approach provides explainable recommendations to guide data exploration while still reserving judgement about interpreting student learning to instructors. The insights derived from applying SIF in an introductory Information Systems course with 407 enrolled students suggest that SIF can be utilised independent of the context and can provide a meaningful interpretation of students' learning behaviour towards facilitating proactive support of students. © 2022 ACM.",,,,,,100,Incorporating Explainable Learning Analytics to Assist Educators with Identifying Students in Need of Attention,Shabaninejad S.; Khosravi H.; Abdi S.; Indulska M.; Sadiq S.,"Shabaninejad, Shiva (57215928305); Khosravi, Hassan (27368031300); Abdi, Solmaz (57215930238); Indulska, Marta (8366424900); Sadiq, Shazia (7006420326)",57215928305; 27368031300; 57215930238; 8366424900; 7006420326,Incorporating Explainable Learning Analytics to Assist Educators with Identifying Students in Need of Attention,2022.0,L@S 2022 - Proceedings of the 9th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,384,388,4.0,2.0,10.1145/3491140.3528292,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132140667&doi=10.1145%2f3491140.3528292&partnerID=40&md5=45e734f226632d3e40722379b0c8efe1,"The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia","Shabaninejad S., The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia; Khosravi H., The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia; Abdi S., The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia; Indulska M., The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia; Sadiq S., The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia",at-risk students; explainable learning analytics; learning analytics dashboards,Learning systems; Predictive analytics; Analytic technique; At-risk student; Data exploration; Explainable learning analytic; High educations; Learning analytic dashboard; Learning behavior; Online learning; Predictive systems; Student learning; Students,,,,,"Australian Research Council’s Industrial Transformation Training Centre for Information Resilience; Australian Government; Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, CIRES, (IC200100022)",Acknowledgement.

Influential Text-Based Features in Predicting Admission Status of Online Degree Applicants,2022,WIP,Work in Progress,"This paper presents the progress made towards developing an equitable predictive model for admission success to an online Master's program with a large pool of applicants. The overarching goal of this project is to help the future development of a systematic evaluation tool for programs with large applications. In the first phase of the project, we collected and processed data on 9,044 applications and have trained a predictive model using applicants' profile information such as demographic data, academic background, and test scores. In an ongoing phase, we seek to expand the applicants' database by incorporating the information in the letters of recommendation (LORs) and statements of purpose (SOPs) that are essential components of the application package for graduate programs and are extensively used to make decisions on granting admission. In this study, we assess various aspects of the LORs and SOPs using natural language processing to extract a comprehensive list of text features that are used to develop a classifier. We implement machine-learning algorithms such as Gradient Boosting to predict admission status and to identify the text features with the highest weight on the applicants' success. This work provides an understanding of the level of significance of a variety of text features that eventually helps the development of a comprehensive predictive model. © 2022 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,Influential Text-Based Features in Predicting Admission Status of Online Degree Applicants,Soleimani F.; Lee J.; Yilmaz Soylu M.; Chatterjee S.,"Soleimani, Farahnaz (57209041720); Lee, Jeonghyun (57219710532); Yilmaz Soylu, Meryem (57374501100); Chatterjee, Saurabh (57478488200)",57209041720; 57219710532; 57374501100; 57478488200,Influential Text-Based Features in Predicting Admission Status of Online Degree Applicants,2022.0,L@S 2022 - Proceedings of the 9th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,360,363,3.0,0.0,10.1145/3491140.3528318,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132154652&doi=10.1145%2f3491140.3528318&partnerID=40&md5=0362fbe4fd4c2e94274307ace1cad532,"Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States","Soleimani F., Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States; Lee J., Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States; Yilmaz Soylu M., Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States; Chatterjee S., Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States",admission criteria; applicant success; machine-learning; predictive analytics.,Adaptive boosting; Application programs; E-learning; Natural language processing systems; Predictive analytics; Admission criteria; Applicant success; Machine-learning; Master programs; Online degree; Predictive analytic.; Predictive models; Systematic evaluation; Text feature; Text-based features; Machine learning,,,,,,,"Ben-Michael E., Feller A., Rothstein J., Variation in impacts of letters of recommendation on college admissions decisions: Approximate balancing weights for treatment effect heterogeneity in observational studies, (2020); Engelhard C., Leugers R., Stephan J., Effectiveness of pre-admission data and letters of recommendation to predict students who will need professional behavior intervention during clinical rotations in the United States, Journal of educational evaluation for health professions, 13, (2016); Girzadas D.V., Harwood R.C., Delis S.N., Stevison K., Keng G., Cipparrone N., Carlson A., Tsonis G.D., Emergency medicine standardized letter of recommendation: Predictors of guaranteed match, Academic Emergency Medicine, 8, 6, pp. 648-653, (2001); Omaer Faruq Goni M., Matin A., Hasan T., Abu Ismail Siddique M., Jyoti O., Sifnatul Hasnain F.M.D., Graduate admission chance prediction using deep neural network, 2020 IEEE International Women in Engineering (WIE) Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (WIECONECE).

Integrating Dynamic Supports into an Equity Teaching Simulation to Promote Equity Mindsets,2022,WIP,Work in Progress,"Implementing high-quality professional learning on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) issues is a massive scaling challenge. Integrating dynamic support using natural language processing (NLP) into equity teaching simulations may allow for more responsive, personalized training in this field. In this study, we trained machine learning models on participants' text responses in an equity teaching simulation (494 users; 988 responses) to detect certain text features related to equity. We then integrated these models into the simulation to provide dynamic supports to users during the simulation. In a pilot study (N = 13), we found users largely thought the feedback was accurate and incorporated the feedback in subsequent simulation responses. Future work will explore replicating these results with larger and more representative samples. © 2022 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,Integrating Dynamic Supports into an Equity Teaching Simulation to Promote Equity Mindsets,Marvez G.R.; Zheng T.; Littenberg-Tobias J.; Hillaire G.; O'Brien S.; Reich J.,"Marvez, G.R.

Additionally, participants found this feedback to be largely accurate and integrated the feedback suggestions into their later performance in the scenario. Future work will be needed to adjust the parameters of our models to provide a more accurate classification and to redesign the feedback participants receive to ensure that they have adequate reflection opportunities. And while early evidence suggests that the supports embedded in the simulation are influential, future work should consider A/B testing support variations to identify optimal supports in terms of changing immediate behavior as well as the long-term effects on behavior change. To conduct such an A/B test, we would like to scale up this study with a larger group of participants. In this demo for Learning at Scale, participants will be able to interact with the natural language processing feedback system in the scenario, and provide feedback to the designers on ways to improve the user experience.

LEDA: A Learning Analytics Based Framework to Analyze Remote Labs Interaction,2022,WIP,Work in Progress,"In order to support the application of digital technologies in the educational context, it is important to understand the relationships between learners and the technologies they use during a practice. Among educational technologies are remote laboratories, tools that provide the manipulation of real experiments through an online platform, available 24/7, overcoming constraints of time and space. To extract information of the large amount of data generated during interactions, it is necessary to use technology-supported representations, in order to apply techniques capable of analyzing and extracting information from the data generated from interactions with technologies and, finally, enabling learning interventions. Learning Analytics (LA) consist of on measuring, collecting, analyzing and reporting student data during practices. LA combines data mining techniques to extract information and pedagogical intervention. This project proposes to develop an educational data mining framework based on Learning Analytics interventions, called LEDA (Laboratory Experimentation Data Analysis). The LEDA framework aims to extract information of interaction data with remote laboratories to relate students' interaction behavior with their learning progress. Our approach will apply association rules and clustering techniques using learning data, including clicks, number of controlled components, and time spent during the activity. © 2022 ACM.",,,,,,100,LEDA: A Learning Analytics Based Framework to Analyze Remote Labs Interaction,Tulha C.N.; Carvalho M.A.G.; De Castro L.N.,"Tulha, Carinna Nunes (57211190131); Carvalho, Marco Antonio G.

Large-scale Analysis of Discussion Networks in College Courses,2022,WIP,Work in Progress,"Online discussion boards serve an important role in college courses by facilitating social learning and student support. However, the student experience and learning outcomes are likely to depend on the structure of student engagement with one another and the teaching staff. Using social network analysis, we investigated the network structure of 616 course discussion boards at a selective research university. We first examine variation in discussion boards using a wide range of composite metrics from the social network analysis literature. We then develop a typology of discussion board networks using principal component analysis and k-Means clustering to arrive at three clusters: dense discussion; distinct discussion groups; and discussion brokers and hubs. © 2022 ACM.",,,,,,100,Large-scale Analysis of Discussion Networks in College Courses,Williamson K.; Kizilcec R.F.,"Williamson, Kimberly (57224642578); Kizilcec, René F.

Laugh at Your Own Pace: Basic Performance Evaluation of Language Learning Assistance by Adjustment of Video Playback Speeds Based on Laughter Detection,2022,WIP,Work in Progress,"Among various methods to learn a second language (L2), such as listening and shadowing, Extensive Viewing involves learning L2 by watching many videos. However, it is difficult for many L2 learners to smoothly and effortlessly comprehend video contents made for native speakers at the original speed. Therefore, we developed a language learning assistance system that automatically adjusts the playback speed according to the learner's comprehension. Our system judges that learners understand the contents if they laugh at the punchlines of comedy dramas, and vice versa. Experimental results show that this system supports learners with relatively low L2 ability (under 700 in TOEIC Score in the experimental condition) to understand video contents. Our system can widen learners' possible options of native speakers' videos as Extensive Viewing material. © 2022 ACM.",,,,,,100,Laugh at Your Own Pace: Basic Performance Evaluation of Language Learning Assistance by Adjustment of Video Playback Speeds Based on Laughter Detection,Nishida N.; Nozaki H.; Shizuki B.,"Nishida, Naoto (57748642800); Nozaki, Hinako (57258649800); Shizuki, Buntarou (6507626386)",57748642800; 57258649800; 6507626386,Laugh at Your Own Pace: Basic Performance Evaluation of Language Learning Assistance by Adjustment of Video Playback Speeds Based on Laughter Detection,2022.0,L@S 2022 - Proceedings of the 9th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,368,373,5.0,3.0,10.1145/3491140.3528299,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132144564&doi=10.1145%2f3491140.3528299&partnerID=40&md5=066d17a21965eec1188850c72401cfb3,"University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan","Nishida N., University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan; Nozaki H., University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan; Shizuki B., University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan",computer-assisted language learning; extensive viewing; facial expression; human-computer interaction; language; learning,Computer aided instruction; E-learning; Learning systems; Video recording; Computer assisted language learning; Extensive viewing; Facial Expressions; Language; Language learning; Learning; Performances evaluation; Playback speed; Video contents; Video Playback; Human computer interaction,,,,,,,"Arakawa R., Yakura H., Mindless Attractor: A False-Positive Resistant Intervention for Drawing Attention Using Auditory Perturbation, Proceedings of the 2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, (2021); Arriaga O., Perception for Autonomous Systems, (2021); Bal-Gezegin B., An Investigation of Using Video vs, Audio for Teaching Vocabulary.

Learning Alone Yet Together: Enhancing Between-Learner Social Connectivity at Scale,2022,WIP,Work in Progress,"MOOCs rely on asynchronous sessions to meet the individual need of a massive number of students geographically distributed. While the asynchronous design ensures the flexibility and accessibility of delivering courses at scale, the absence of synchronous opportunities brings up problems such as reduced interactivity and even the sense of isolation. However, as synchronicity in essence contradicts the asynchronous design which is considered to foster the fundamental appeal of MOOCs, adding synchronous parts to MOOCs in a simple and straightforward way is not feasible. To address this, an emerging functionality which is popular in entertainment video watching but newly used in MOOC learning is explored and evaluated. In this functionality, the lecture video and communication between learners are still implemented in an asynchronous way whereas the chat messages sent by previous and present learners in the process of watching are organized and displayed according to their sending timestamps along the video playback timeline to create an atmosphere of 'pseudo-synchronicity'. This study first evaluated the effect of this new design on learner interaction and compared the results with learners' use of the traditional discussion posts which served as the baseline of affording learning connectivity here. Then the findings were contrasted and consolidated with the feedback from learners in a survey. Preliminary results show that despite the difficulty in translating the temporary learning connections into deeper social relationships, this new system can effectively deliver the sense of connectedness to learners in their MOOC learning process. © 2022 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,Learning Alone Yet Together: Enhancing Between-Learner Social Connectivity at Scale,Yang B.; He H.,"Yang, Bo (57220789724); He, Huyang (57748641100)",57220789724; 57748641100,Learning Alone Yet Together: Enhancing Between-Learner Social Connectivity at Scale,2022.0,L@S 2022 - Proceedings of the 9th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,374,378,4.0,1.0,10.1145/3491140.3528294,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132153632&doi=10.1145%2f3491140.3528294&partnerID=40&md5=a61888cb5274d617616ff470aa992901,"University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden; Chengdu Yulin Primary School, Chengdu, China","Yang B., University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden; He H., Chengdu Yulin Primary School, Chengdu, China",danmaku; MOOCs; sense of connectedness; social learning,Learning systems; Asynchronous design; Danmaku; Interactivity; Lecture video; MOOC; Sense of connectedness; Simple++; Social learning; Time-stamp; Video Playback; Curricula,,,,,,,"Wise A.F., Cui Y., Learning communities in the crowd: Characteristics of content related interactions and social relationships in mooc discussion forums, Computers & Education, 122, pp. 221-242, (2018); Crues R., Bosch N., Perry M., Angrave L., Shaik N., Bhat S., Refocusing the Lens on Engagement in MOOCs, Proceedings of the fifth ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale.

Math Discourse Linguistic Components (Cohesive Cues within a Math Discussion Board Discourse),2022,WIP,Work in Progress,"This study presents the results of a computational discourse analysis of discussion threads within an online Math tutoring platform. This work is theoretically motivated by prior work that established the importance of linguistic and semantic features in the discourse in mathematics education. The end goal of this study is to understand the characteristics of language that is produced and used within a discussion board for math. The discussion board corpus comprises of posts from 4,720 students, teachers, and study experts who interacted within an online teaching and learning tutoring platform for math. Linguistic profiles of the discussion board discourse were estimated using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based on Coh-Metrix linguistic features related to cohesion, language sophistication, and lexical characteristics. The PCA analysis yielded seven Math Discourse Linguistic Components, which collectively explained 49% of the variance in the dataset. Theoretical and conceptual validation of components revealed that the linguistic features align with the communication goal and the nature of mathematics. The linguistic profiles that characterized the discussion board discourse included referential cohesion, information density, instructional language, lexical variation, compare and contrast devices, explicit relations devices, and syntactic complexity. The dominance of cohesive cues within the linguistic profiles demonstrate the communication goals within the Math discourse such as elaboration, providing instruction, compare and contrast, establishing explicit relations, and presenting information. As such, these components characterize the Math Discussion Board discourse in terms of variations in cohesive and task-oriented cues within communication among students. © 2022 ACM.",,,,,,100,Math Discourse Linguistic Components (Cohesive Cues within a Math Discussion Board Discourse),Banawan M.; Shin J.; Balyan R.; Leite W.L.; McNamara D.S.,"Banawan, Michelle (56534256300); Shin, Jinnie (57209368772); Balyan, Renu (55314411800); Leite, Walter L.

Measuring Cultural Dimensions of Learning in Online Courses,2022,WIP,Work in Progress,"Online courses lower geographic barriers to educational access and attract learners from around the world. The resulting cultural diversity in online courses has implications for learning preferences, behaviors and outcomes, but established measures of culture are not adapted to educational contexts. We adapted and tested a survey instrument of cultural dimensions of learning that is grounded in cultural psychology research and spans four dimensions: knowledge construction, pedagogical orientation, uncertainty tolerance, and consensus building. We collected 600 responses in two online courses, conducted an explanatory factor analysis, and compared responses across five countries. We found that the instrument has a clear factor structure with high internal consistency, and it can distinguish cultures between countries. The instrument can be used to better understand learners and their culture in the process of course design and evaluation. © 2022 ACM.",,,,,,100,Measuring Cultural Dimensions of Learning in Online Courses,Cho J.Y.; Li Y.; Krasny M.E.; Kizilcec R.F.,"Cho, Ji Yong (57202043077); Li, Yue (56448682500); Krasny, Marianne E.

Re-envisioning a K-12 Early Warning System with School Climate Factors,2022,WIP,Work in Progress,"The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) prescribes holistic measures of schools for student success and well-being. However, many early warning systems rely exclusively on the ""Attendance, Behavior, Course""(ABC) taxonomy, which misses potentially crucial determinants such as school climate and students' socioemotional learning. We report early findings from a larger project that aims to apply machine learning methods to improve an early warning system by incorporating factors related to school climate and socioemotional learning. These preliminary analyses suggest that a culturally inclusive, socially supportive, and emotionally and physically safe school climate is related to academic success and fewer engagement/behavior problems at the school level. They suggest the promise of integrating these features into early warning systems to help schools change their practices to better support student well-being. © 2022 ACM.",,,,,,100,Re-envisioning a K-12 Early Warning System with School Climate Factors,Su M.; Olson L.A.; Jarratt D.C.; Varma S.; Konstan J.A.; Keller R.J.L.; Chen B.,"Su, Mengchen (57221441140); Olson, Lukas A.

Revealing Factors Influencing Students' Perceived Fairness: A Case with a Predictive System for Math Learning,2022,WIP,Work in Progress,"Educational researchers have examined artificial intelligence (AI) to automatically support students' learning at a large scale. However, it has been broadly identified that AI models can suffer from algorithmic bias. A recent educational research initiative has shifted to evaluate and address algorithmic bias. Nonetheless, few studies have examined students' perceived fairness towards AI-enhanced systems in education. This study aimed to explore and understand factors that shape students' perceived fairness towards an AI system for math learning at the college level. Specifically, we have conducted a between-subjects randomized experiment with 395 participants to reveal factors that influenced participants' perceptions of fairness. The results showed that students' math anxiety levels and majors could influence participants' reported perceived fairness. In contrast, the outcome favorability of the predictive system did not affect students' perceptions of fairness. Future investigations have been planned to further understand the relationships between the designed manipulations and perceived fairness. © 2022 ACM.",,,,,,100,Revealing Factors Influencing Students' Perceived Fairness: A Case with a Predictive System for Math Learning,Li C.; Xing W.,"Li, Chenglu (57208421439); Xing, Wanli (55983407600)",57208421439; 55983407600,Revealing Factors Influencing Students' Perceived Fairness: A Case with a Predictive System for Math Learning,2022.0,L@S 2022 - Proceedings of the 9th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,409,412,3.0,2.0,10.1145/3491140.3528293,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131592027&doi=10.1145%2f3491140.3528293&partnerID=40&md5=db407da0c07e9c5823d2066b20f79a2f,"University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, United States","Li C., University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, United States; Xing W., University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, United States",fair AI; human-centered computing; math learning; perceived fairness,Education computing; Learning systems; Algorithmics; Educational research; Fair artificial intelligence; Human-centered computing; Intelligence models; Large-scales; Math learning; Perceived fairness; Predictive systems; Student learning; Students,,,,,"University of Florida, UF, (P0195022)",The research reported here was supported by the University of Florida AI Catalyst Grant -P0195022 and the University of Florida Informatics Institute Seed Funding.

Scaling Up Access to the Hidden Curriculum: A Design Methodology for Creating Undergraduate Mentoring Guides,2022,WIP,Work in Progress,"The hidden curriculum consists of the unwritten rules, unspoken norms, and field-specific insider knowledge that are essential for student success but are not taught in classes. Examples include how to approach professors and prospective employers to ask for opportunities and how to gather information that is relevant to one's career goals. Students now informally learn these skills from more experienced peers, but not everyone has access to personalized one-on-one mentoring. We scaled up access to the hidden curriculum by creating a mentoring guide to advise students majoring in HCI/Design at our university. Readers have found it useful for orienting new students, helping older students who feel behind, and serving as a confidence booster.

Seeking Exemplars in the Wild: Exploring How Students Find Design Examples to Support Personalized Learning,2022,WIP,Work in Progress,"Examples help students learn insights about key domain principles and processes. However, little is known about how students leverage the Web to discover and learn from examples. In a comparative study, seventy undergraduate students leveraged three types of platforms - - search-based, crit-based, and portfolio-based platforms - -to find examples that represent contrasting cases of two design principles. Students reported how each platform's features and mechanisms affected their approach. We identify three main strategies students employed for finding examples on the Web: developing keywords, visually comparing multiple examples, and leveraging community feedback to assess example quality. Our results also indicate that, despite giving access to many examples, none of the existing platforms provide explicit support for learning. We distill three guidelines for creating learner-centered online design galleries to help future learners gain design knowledge. © 2022 ACM.",,,,,,100,Seeking Exemplars in the Wild: Exploring How Students Find Design Examples to Support Personalized Learning,Yen Y.-C.G.; Dow S.P.,"Yen, Yu-Chun Grace (15849923300); Dow, Steven P.

Student Use of Course Reviews at Scale,2022,WIP,Work in Progress,"Students have developed their own platforms for sharing their evaluations of courses over the Internet. These are typically focused on the needs and experience of students in traditional undergraduate programs, but the rise of online programs operating at scale has made it practical for students to develop such a platform dedicated to their particular program. We have used a survey to gather information from students in such a program at a major research institution in the United States. Through this data we explore how many students are using the site, how they use the information, and also how often and why they write reviews.

Teaching and Learning Programming with Linux using In-Browser Client-Side Web Technologies: Exploring the Key Features for Achieving Systems and Tools Scalability,2022,WIP,Work in Progress,"This paper explores the key features for achieving systems and tools scalability for online learning. We created large scale tools used in popular online courses on teaching and learning programming with Linux that take advantage of client-side web technologies. We advocate for more compatible, interoperable and light tools and systems that are resilient, elastic, traceable, responsive and secure. We also think social features should be considered like friendliness, accessibility, openness and re-usability. Those features could be used to assess the quality and the scalability potential of MOOCs by choosing different metrics to evaluate for each introduced feature. In doing so we hope to diversify the standard indicators of the success of online courses, especially regarding their scalability, and give some examples for STEM courses. © 2022 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,Teaching and Learning Programming with Linux using In-Browser Client-Side Web Technologies: Exploring the Key Features for Achieving Systems and Tools Scalability,Sharrock R.;

The Relationship Between COVID-19 Severity and Computer Science MOOC Learner Achievement: A Preliminary Analysis,2022,WIP,Work in Progress,"Online education, and MOOCs in particular, experienced a dramatic rise during the COVID-19 lockdown. Many had extra time to start learning new topics, while a significant fraction of the population experienced disruptions in areas such as healthcare, childcare, and potential loss of livelihood, among others. In this work we analyze learner data from multiple instances of two introductory Python MOOCs, offered before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, to understand how the pandemic affected learner progress and outcomes in these courses. We explore multiple measures of COVID-19 severity, and find a strong correlation between a measure of severity and relative change in certification rate. Specifically, we find that the change in certification rate relative to pre-pandemic baselines showed a negative correlation as COVID-19 severity increased. © 2022 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,The Relationship Between COVID-19 Severity and Computer Science MOOC Learner Achievement: A Preliminary Analysis,Yee M.; Roy A.; Stein J.; Perdue M.; Bell A.; Carter R.; Miyagawa S.,"Yee, Michael (23479017000); Roy, Anindya (57672326500); Stein, Julius (57746675800); Perdue, Meghan (57218225588); Bell, Ana (57215551299); Carter, Ronisha (57748618700); Miyagawa, Shigeru (7201867694)",23479017000; 57672326500; 57746675800; 57218225588; 57215551299; 57748618700; 7201867694,The Relationship Between COVID-19 Severity and Computer Science MOOC Learner Achievement: A Preliminary Analysis,2022.0,L@S 2022 - Proceedings of the 9th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,431,435,4.0,1.0,10.1145/3491140.3528325,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132158298&doi=10.1145%2f3491140.3528325&partnerID=40&md5=a8d0fac6a8bda050c73c6c5be5dc038c,"Mit Lincoln Laboratory, Lexington, MA, United States; Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States; DAF/MIT Ai Accelerator, Cambridge, MA, United States","Yee M., Mit Lincoln Laboratory, Lexington, MA, United States; Roy A., Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States; Stein J., Mit Lincoln Laboratory, Lexington, MA, United States; Perdue M., Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States; Bell A., Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States; Carter R., DAF/MIT Ai Accelerator, Cambridge, MA, United States; Miyagawa S., Mit Lincoln Laboratory, Lexington, MA, United States",change in learning behavior and attainment; covid-19; moocs,Education computing; Change in learning behavior and attainment; Covid-19; Learning behavior; Moocs; Multiple instances; Negative correlation; On-line education; Potential loss; Preliminary analysis; Strong correlation; COVID-19,,,,,"United States Air Force Artificial Intelligence Accelerator, (FA8750-19-2-1000); United States Air Force Research Laboratory","Research was sponsored by the United States Air Force Research Laboratory and the United States Air Force Artificial Intelligence Accelerator and was accomplished under Cooperative Agreement Number FA8750-19-2-1000.

Towards a Teacher Application to Support Semantic Annotations of Learning Tasks in Cultural Heritage,2022,WIP,Work in Progress,"New generations should learn about the Cultural Heritage (CH) that surrounds them to value and preserve it. Common strategies for learning CH include lectures, textbooks, and also cultural visits to CH sites. Cultural visits allow very rich learning experiences but are quite challenging to prepare and carry out. This paper presents Cultural Heritage Educational Semantic Tool (CHEST), a web application that enables teachers to identify monuments of interest and annotate them with learning tasks. The created learning tasks will be carried out by students using an existing application, named Casual Learn, that makes use of a dataset of learning tasks created from information available as Linked Open Data. CHEST overcomes an identified limitation of Casual Learn by giving the teachers the possibility of enriching the existing semantic dataset of monuments and associated learning tasks with customized content while hiding the technical complexity of Semantic Web technologies. Additionally, CHEST promotes the reusability and adaptation of learning tasks by different teachers. An early version of CHEST was used by two secondary school teachers in real-life situations to design customized tasks for their students. These tasks were then carried out by the students via Casual Learn. These teachers gave a high usability score to CHEST and were interviewed to obtain further feedback. They were keen to publish new tasks, share them with other teachers, and reuse tasks from other teachers. © 2022 ACM.",,,,,,100,Towards a Teacher Application to Support Semantic Annotations of Learning Tasks in Cultural Heritage,García-Zarza P.; Bote-Lorenzo M.L.; Vega-Gorgojo G.; Asensio-Pérez J.I.,"García-Zarza, Pablo (57219053429); Bote-Lorenzo, Miguel L.

Understanding the Relationship Between Students' Learning Outcome and Behavioral Patterns using Touch Trajectories,2022,WIP,Work in Progress,"In this paper, we extend existing research on using geometric features extracted from trajectory data to understand student behavioral patterns and learning outcome. We analyzed 910,661 trajectories data from 390 students who played the KitKit School, a mathematics educational game. As a result of factor analysis, three behavioral patterns are computed: conflict, wavering, and locomotion. A conflict pattern is the degree of curvature of trajectory and implies the degree of decision conflict. A wavering pattern is the number of times when the directions of a trajectory change and refers to the level of confusion a user may feel between choices. Locomotion pattern is the trajectory length of a user's movement while making a choice. The correlation analysis results show that conflict (r=-0.145, p=0.004) and wavering (r=-0.100, p=0.049) negatively correlated with the learning outcome.

Using a Planning Prompt Survey to Encourage Early Completion of Homework Assignments,2022,WIP,Work in Progress,"In an earlier study we showed that small amounts of extra credit offered for early progress on online homework assignments can reduce cramming behavior in introductory physics students. This work expands on the prior study by implementing a planning prompt intervention inspired by Yeomans and Reich's similar treatment. In the prompt we asked students to what degree they intended to earn extra credit offered for early work on the module sequence, and what their plan was to realize their intentions. The survey was assigned for ordinary course credit and due several days before the first extra credit deadline. We found that students who completed the prompt earned on average 0.6 more extra credit points and completed the modules an average of 1.1 days earlier compared to a previous semester. We detect the impact of the survey by creating a multilinear model based on data from students exposed to the intervention as well as students in a previous semester. Data from five homework sequences are included in the model to account for differences between the two semesters that cannot be attributed to the planning prompt intervention. © 2022 ACM.",,,,,,100,Using a Planning Prompt Survey to Encourage Early Completion of Homework Assignments,Felker Z.; Chen Z.,"Felker, Zachary (57240353500); Chen, Zhongzhou (7409482654)",57240353500; 7409482654,Using a Planning Prompt Survey to Encourage Early Completion of Homework Assignments,2022.0,L@S 2022 - Proceedings of the 9th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,446,450,4.0,1.0,10.1145/3491140.3528297,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132177261&doi=10.1145%2f3491140.3528297&partnerID=40&md5=d09e1f8e6c53012e029a503671af20ff,"University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, United States","Felker Z., University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, United States; Chen Z., University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, United States",extra credit; online learning; planning prompt; self-regulated learning; SRL,E-learning; Surveys; Exposed to; Extra credit; Homework assignments; Model-based OPC; Multilinear models; On-line homeworks; Online learning; Planning prompt; Self-regulated learning; SRL; Students,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF, (DUE 1845436)",The authors are grateful to the Instructional Systems and Technology team at the University of Central Florida’s Center for Distributed Learning for developing the Obojobo platform and providing the log data for analysis.

Where are the Large N Studies in Education?: Introducing a Dataset of Scientific Articles and NLP Techniques,2022,WIP,Work in Progress,"Research, especially in Education, is hampered by scale and our aim is to help shift this dynamic by tracking relevant studies from major scientific venues. The current version of our dataset considers top conferences and journals from the domain (N = 33,531). Several heuristics using advanced text searches and regular expressions, together with NLP techniques ranging from part of speech tagging, syntactic dependency parsing, to semantic models, are employed to extract relevant studies. Our method achieves an F1 score of .633 when employed on a manually annotated subset of 1,000 articles. When applied to the entire dataset, the total number of articles with large N was around 10%, with a positive trend in the last years. L@S was by far the venue with the highest density of identified articles, thus arguing for its emphasis on scale. Further filtering of the articles is required when focusing only on learning, as the articles span across multiple domains and have multiple interests. Nonetheless, the order of magnitude raises current problems, namely that these studies are scarce and future endeavors should emphasize the importance of scale. Our dataset, including the validation subset, and the corresponding code for data crawling, PDF processing, and large N extraction mechanisms, have been open-sourced to further support the initiative and stimulate new analyses. © 2022 ACM.",,,,,,100,Where are the Large N Studies in Education?

Replicating MOOC Predictive Models at Scale,2018,Full Paper,,"We present a case study in predictive model replication for student dropout in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) using a large and diverse dataset (133 sessions of 28 unique courses o ered by two institutions). This experiment was run on the MOOC Replication Framework (MORF), which makes it feasible to fully replicate complex machine learned models, from raw data to model evaluation. We provide an overview of the MORF platform architecture and functionality, and demonstrate its use through a case study. In this replication of [41], we contextualize and evaluate the results of the previous work using statistical tests and a more e ective model evaluation scheme. We find that only some of the original findings replicate across this larger and more diverse sample of MOOCs, with others replicating significantly in the opposite direction. Our analysis also reveals results which are highly relevant to the prediction task which were not reported in the original experiment. This work demonstrates the importance of replication of predictive modeling research in MOOCs using large and diverse datasets, illuminates the challenges of doing so, and describes our freely available, open-source software framework to overcome barriers to replication. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.

"Students, Systems, and Interactions: Synthesizing the First Four Years of Learning@Scale and Charting the Future",2018,Full Paper,,"We survey all four years of papers published so far at the Learning at Scale conference in order to reflect on the major research areas that have been investigated and to chart possible directions for future study. We classified all 69 full papers so far into three categories: Systems for Learning at Scale, Interactions with Sociotechnical Systems, and Understanding Online Students. Systems papers presented technologies that varied by how much they amplify human effort (e.g., one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many). Interaction papers studied both individual and group interactions with learning technologies. Finally, student-centric study papers focused on modeling knowledge and on promoting global access and equity. We conclude by charting future research directions related to topics such as going beyond the MOOC hype cycle, axes of scale for systems, more immersive course experiences, learning on mobile devices, diversity in student personas, students as co-creators, and fostering better social connections amongst students. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.

The Potential for Scientific Outreach and Learning in Mechanical Turk Experiments,2018,Full Paper,,"The global reach of online experiments and their wide adoption in fields ranging from political science to computer science poses an underexplored opportunity for learning at scale: The possibility of participants learning about the research to which they contribute data. We conducted three experiments on Amazon's Mechanical Turk to evaluate whether participants of paid online experiments are interested in learning about research, what information they find most interesting, and whether providing them with such information actually leads to learning gains. Our findings show that 40% of our participants on Mechanical Turk actively sought out post-experiment learning opportunities despite having already received their financial compensation. Participants expressed high interest in a range of research topics, including previous research and experimental design. Finally, we find that participants comprehend and accurately recall facts from post-experiment learning opportunities. Our findings suggest that Mechanical Turk can be a valuable platform for learning at scale and scientific outreach. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.

Toward Large-Scale Learning Design Categorizing Course Designs in Service of Supporting Learning Outcomes,2018,Full Paper,,"This paper applies theory and methodology from the learning design literature to large-scale learning environments through quantitative modeling of the structure and design of Massive Open Online Courses. For two institutions of higher education, we automate the task of encoding pedagogy and learning design principles for 177 courses (which accounted for for nearly 4 million enrollments). Course materials from these MOOCs are parsed and abstracted into sequences of components, such as videos and problems. Our key contributions are (i) describing the parsing and abstraction of courses for quantitative analyses, (ii) the automated categorization of similar course designs, and (iii) the identification of key structural components that show relationships between categories and learning design principles. We employ two methods to categorize similar course designs-one aimed at clustering courses using transition probabilities and another using trajectory mining. We then proceed with an exploratory analysis of relationships between our categorization and learning outcomes. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.

Addressing Two Problems in Deep Knowledge Tracing via Prediction-Consistent Regularization,2018,Full Paper,,"Knowledge tracing is one of the key research areas for empowering personalized education. It is a task to model students' mastery level of a knowledge component (KC) based on their historical learning trajectories. In recent years, a recurrent neural network model called deep knowledge tracing (DKT) has been proposed to handle the knowledge tracing task and literature has shown that DKT generally outperforms traditional methods. However, through our extensive experimentation, we have noticed two major problems in the DKT model. The first problem is that the model fails to reconstruct the observed input. As a result, even when a student performs well on a KC, the prediction of that KC's mastery level decreases instead, and vice versa. Second, the predicted performance for KCs across time-steps is not consistent. This is undesirable and unreasonable because student's performance is expected to transit gradually over time. To address these problems, we introduce regularization terms that correspond to reconstruction and waviness to the loss function of the original DKT model to enhance the consistency in prediction. Experiments show that the regularized loss function effectively alleviates the two problems without degrading the original task of DKT. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.

The Effects of Adaptive Learning in a Massive Open Online Course on Learners’ Skill Development,2018,Full Paper,,"We report an experimental implementation of adaptive learning functionality in a self-paced Microsoft MOOC (massive open online course) on edX. In a personalized adaptive system, the learner's progress toward clearly defined goals is continually assessed, the assessment occurs when a student is ready to demonstrate competency, and supporting materials are tailored to the needs of each learner. Despite the promise of adaptive personalized learning, there is a lack of evidence-based instructional design, transparency in many of the models and algorithms used to provide adaptive technology or a framework for rapid experimentation with different models. ALOSI (Adaptive Learning Open Source Initiative) provides open source adaptive learning technology and a common framework to measure learning gains and learner behavior. This study explored the effects of two different strategies for adaptive learning and assessment: Learners were randomly assigned to three groups. In the first adaptive group ALOSI prioritized a strategy of remediation-serving learners items on topics with the least evidence of mastery; in the second adaptive group ALOSI prioritized a strategy of continuity-that is learners would be more likely served items on similar topic in a sequence until mastery is demonstrated. The control group followed the pathways of the course as set out by the instructional designer, with no adaptive algorithms. We found that the implemented adaptivity in assessment, with emphasis on remediation is associated with a substantial increase in learning gains, while producing no big effect on the drop-out. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and explore additional possible effects and implications to course design. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.

QG-Net: A Data-Driven Question Generation Model for Educational Content,2018,Full Paper,,"The ever growing amount of educational content renders it increasingly difficult to manually generate sufficient practice or quiz questions to accompany it. This paper introduces QG-Net, a recurrent neural network-based model specifically designed for automatically generating quiz questions from educational content such as textbooks. QG-Net, when trained on a publicly available, general-purpose question/answer dataset and without further fine-tuning, is capable of generating high quality questions from textbooks, where the content is significantly different from the training data. Indeed, QG-Net outperforms state-of-the-art neural network-based and rules-based systems for question generation, both when evaluated using standard benchmark datasets and when using human evaluators. QGNet also scales favorably to applications with large amounts of educational content, since its performance improves with the amount of training data. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.

Towards Domain General Detection of Transactive Knowledge Building Behavior,2018,Full Paper,,"Support of discussion based learning at scale benefits from automated analysis of discussion for enabling effective assignment of students to project teams, for triggering dynamic support of group learning processes, and for assessment of those learning processes. A major limitation of much past work in machine learning applied to automated analysis of discussion is the failure of the models to generalize to data outside of the parameters of the context in which the training data was collected. This limitation means that a separate training effort must be undertaken for each domain in which the models will be used. This paper focuses on a specific construct of discussion based learning referred to as Transactivity and provides a novel machine learning approach with performance that exceeds state-of-the-art performance within the same domain in which it was trained and a new domain, and does not suffer any reduction in performance when transferring to the new domain. These results stand as an advance over past work on automated detection of Transactivity and increase the value of trained models for supporting group learning at scale. Implications for practice in at-scale learning environments are discussed. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.

Docent: Transforming personal intuitions to scientific hypotheses through content learning and process training,2018,Full Paper,,"People's lived experiences provide intuitions about health. Can they transform these personal intuitions into testable hypotheses that could inform both science and their lives? This paper introduces an online learning architecture and provides system principles for people to brainstorm causal scientific theories. We describe the Learn-Train-Ask workflow that guides participants through learning domain-specific content, process training to frame their intuitions as hypotheses, and collaborating with anonymous peers to brainstorm related questions. 344 voluntary online participants from 27 countries created 399 personally-relevant questions about the human microbiome over 4 months, 75 (19%) of which microbiome experts found potentially scientifically novel. Participants with access to process training generated hypotheses of better quality. Access to learning materials improved the questions' microbiome-specific knowledge. These results highlight the promise of performing personally-meaningful scientific work using massive online learning systems. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.

Supporting Answerers with Feedback in Social Q&A,2018,Full Paper,,"Prior research has examined the use of Social Question and Answer (QandA) websites for answer and help seeking. However, the potential for these websites to support domain learning has not yet been realized. Helping users write effective answers can be beneficial for subject area learning for both answerers and the recipients of answers. In this study, we examine the utility of crowdsourced, criteria-based feedback for answerers on a student-centered QandA website, Brainly.com. In an experiment with 55 users, we compared perceptions of the current rating system against two feedback designs with explicit criteria (Appropriate, Understandable, and Generalizable). Contrary to our hypotheses, answerers disagreed with and rejected the criteria-based feedback.

Refocusing the Lens on Engagement in MOOCs,2018,Full Paper,,"Massive open online courses (MOOCs) continue to see increasing enrollment and adoption by universities, although they are still not fully understood and could perhaps be significantly improved. For example, little is known about the relationships between the ways in which students choose to use MOOCs (e.g., sampling lecture videos, discussing topics with fellow students) and their overall level of engagement with the course, although these relationships are likely key to effective course implementation. In this paper we propose a multilevel definition of student engagement with MOOCs and explore the connections between engagement and students' behaviors across five unique courses. We modeled engagement using ordinal penalized logistic regression with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and found several predictors of engagement that were consistent across courses. In particular, we found that discussion activities (e.g., viewing forum posts) were positively related to engagement, whereas other types of student behaviors (e.g., attempting quizzes) were consistently related to less engagement with the course. Finally, we discuss implications of unexpected findings that replicated across courses, future work to explore these implications, and relevance of our findings for MOOC course design. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.

"The Relationship between Scientific Explanations and the Proficiencies of Content, Inquiry, and Writing",2018,Full Paper,,"Examining the interaction between content knowledge, inquiry proficiency, and writing proficiency is central to understanding the relative contribution of each proficiency on students' written communication about their science inquiry. Previous studies, however, have only analyzed one of these primary types of knowledge/proficiencies (i.e. content knowledge, inquiry proficiency, and writing proficiency) at a time. This study investigated the extent to which these proficiencies predicted students' written claims, evidence for their claims, and reasoning linking their claims to the evidence. Results showed that all three types of proficiencies significantly predicted students' claims, but only writing proficiency significantly predicted performance on evidence and reasoning statements. These findings indicate the challenges students face when constructing claim, evidence, and reasoning statements, and can inform scaffolding to support these challenges. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.

Classifying and Visualizing Students’ Cognitive Engagement in Course Readings,2018,Full Paper,,"Reading material has been part of course teaching for centuries, but until recently students' engagement with that reading, and its effect on their learning, has been difficult for teachers to assess. In this article, we explore the idea of examining cognitive engagement-a measure of how deeply a student is thinking about course material, which has been shown to correlate with learning gains-as it varies over different sections of the course reading material. We show that a combination of automatic classification and visualization of cognitive engagement anchored in the text can give teachers-and not only researchers-valuable insight into their students' thinking, suggesting ways to modify their lectures and their course readings to improve learning. We demonstrate this approach with analyzing students' comments in two different courses (Physics and Biology) using the Nota Bene annotation platform. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.

Squeezing the Limeade: Policies and Workflows for Scalable Online Degrees,2018,Full Paper,,"In recent years, non-credit options for learning at scale have outpaced for-credit options. To scale for-credit options, workflows and policies must be devised to preserve the characteristics of accredited higher education-such as the presumption of human evaluation and an assertion of academic integrity-despite increased scale. These efforts must follow as well with shifting from offering isolated courses (or informal collections thereof) to offering full degree programs with additional administrative elements. We see this shift as one from Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) to Large, Internet-Mediated Asynchronous Degrees (Limeades). In this work, we perform a qualitative research study on one such program that has scaled to 6,500 students while retaining full accreditation. We report a typology of policies and workflows employed by the individual classes to deliver this experience. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.

How Do Professors Format Exams? An Analysis of Question Variety at Scale,2018,Full Paper,,"This study analyzes the use of paper exams in college-level STEM courses. It leverages a unique dataset of nearly 1,800 exams, which were scanned into a web application, then processed by a team of annotators to yield a detailed snapshot of the way instructors currently structure exams. The focus of the investigation is on the variety of question formats, and how they are applied across different course topics. The analysis divides questions according to seven top-level categories, finding significant differences among these in terms of positioning, use across subjects, and student performance. The analysis also reveals a strong tendency within the collection for instructors to order questions from easier to harder. A linear mixed effects model is used to estimate the reliability of different question types. Long writing questions stand out for their high reliability, while binary and multiple choice questions have low reliability. The model suggests that over three multiple choice questions, or over five binary questions, are required to attain the same reliability as a single long writing question. A correlation analysis across seven response types finds that student abilities for different questions types exceed 70 percent for all pairs, although binary and multiple-choice questions stand out for having unusually low correlations with all other question types. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.

OARS: Exploring Instructor Analytics for Online Learning,2018,Full Paper,,"Learning analytics systems have the potential to bring enormous value to online education. Unfortunately, many instructors and platforms do not adequately leverage learning analytics in their courses today. In this paper, we report on the value of these systems from the perspective of course instructors. We study these ideas through OARS, a modular and real-time learning analytics system that we deployed across more than ten online courses with tens of thousands of learners. We leverage this system as a starting point for semi-structured interviews with a diverse set of instructors. Our study suggests new design goals for learning analytics systems, the importance of real-time analytics to many instructors, and the value of flexibility in data selection and aggregation for an instructor when working with an analytics system. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.

The Potential of Interdisciplinarity in MOOC Research: How Do Education and Computer Science Intersect?,2018,Full Paper,,"Given that both computer scientists and educational researchers publish on the topic of massive open online courses (MOOCs), the research community should analyze how these disciplines approach the same topic. In order to promote productive dialogue within the community, we report on a bibliometrics study of the growing MOOC literature and examine the potential interdisciplinarity of this research space. Drawing from 3,380 bibliographic items retrieved from Scopus, we conducted descriptive analyses on publication years, publication sources, disciplinary categories of publication sources, frequent keywords, leading authors, and cited references. We applied bibliographic coupling and network analysis to further investigate clusters of research topics in the MOOC literature.

Codemotion: Expanding the Design Space of Learner Interactions with Computer Programming Tutorial Videos,2018,Full Paper,,"Love them or hate them, videos are a pervasive format for delivering online education at scale. They are especially popular for computer programming tutorials since videos convey expert narration alongside the dynamic effects of editing and running code. However, these screencast videos simply consist of raw pixels, so there is no way to interact with the code embedded inside of them. To expand the design space of learner interactions with programming videos, we developed Codemotion, a computer vision algorithm that automatically extracts source code and dynamic edits from existing videos. Codemotion segments a video into regions that likely contain code, performs OCR on those segments, recognizes source code, and merges together related code edits into contiguous intervals. We used Codemotion to build a novel video player and then elicited interaction design ideas from potential users by running an elicitation study with 10 students followed by four participatory design workshops with 12 additional students. Participants collectively generated ideas for 28 kinds of interactions such as inline code editing, code-based skimming, pop-up video search, and in-video coding exercises. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.

Elicast: Embedding Interactive Exercises in Instructional Programming Screencasts,2018,Full Paper,,"In programming education, instructors often supplement lectures with active learning experiences by offering programming lab sessions where learners themselves practice writing code. However, widely accessed instructional programming screencasts are not equipped with assessment format that encourages such hands-on programming activities. We introduce Elicast, a screencast tool for recording and viewing programming lectures with embedded programming exercises, to provide hands-on programming experiences in the screencast. In Elicast, instructors embed multiple programming exercises while creating a screencast, and learners engage in the exercises by writing code within the screencast, receiving auto-graded results immediately.We conducted an exploratory study of Elicast with five experienced instructors and 63 undergraduate students. We found that instructors structured the lectures into small learning units using embedded exercises as checkpoints. Also, learners more actively engaged in the screencast lectures, checked their understanding of the content through the embedded exercises, and more frequently modified and executed the code during the lectures. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.

Toward CS1 at Scale: Building and Testing a MOOC-for-Credit Candidate,2018,Full Paper,,"If a MOOC is to qualify for equal credit as an existing on-campus offering, students must achieve comparable outcomes, both educational and attitudinal. We have built a MOOC for teaching CS1 with the intent of offering it for degree credit. To test its eligibility for credit, we delivered it as an online for-credit course for two semesters to 197 on-campus students who selected the online version rather than a traditional version. We compared the demographics, outcomes, and experiences of these students to the 715 students in the traditional version. We found the online students more likely to be older; to be underrepresented minorities; and to have previously failed a CS class. We then found that our online students attained comparable learning outcomes to students in the traditional section. Finally, we found that our online students perceived the online course quality more positively and required less time to achieve those comparable learning outcomes. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.

Effects of Automated Interventions in Programming Assignments: Evidence from a Field Experiment,2018,Full Paper,,"A typical problem in MOOCs is the missing opportunity for course conductors to individually support students in overcoming their problems and misconceptions. This paper presents the results of automatically intervening on struggling students during programming exercises and offering peer feedback and tailored bonus exercises. To improve learning success, we do not want to abolish instructionally desired trial and error but reduce extensive struggle and demotivation. Therefore, we developed adaptive automatic just-in-time interventions to encourage students to ask for help if they require considerably more than average working time to solve an exercise. Additionally, we offered students bonus exercises tailored for their individual weaknesses. The approach was evaluated within a live course with over 5,000 active students via a survey and metrics gathered alongside. Results show that we can increase the call outs for help by up to 66% and lower the dwelling time until issuing action. Learnings from the experiments can further be used to pinpoint course material to be improved and tailor content to be audience specific. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.

The unbearable lightness of consent: Mapping MOOC providers’ response to consent,2018,Full Paper,,"While many strategies for protecting personal privacy have relied on regulatory frameworks, consent and anonymizing data, such approaches are not always effective. Frameworks and Terms and Conditions often lag user behaviour and advances in technology and software; consent can be provisional and fragile; and the anonymization of data may impede personalized learning. This paper reports on a dialogical multi-case study methodology of four Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) providers from different geopolitical and regulatory contexts. It explores how the providers (1) define 'personal data' and whether they acknowledge a category of 'special' or 'sensitive' data; (2) address the issue and scope of student consent (and define that scope); and (3) use student data in order to inform pedagogy and/or adapt the learning experience to personalise the context or to increase student retention and success rates. This study found that large amounts of personal data continue to be collected for purposes seemingly unrelated to the delivery and support of courses. The capacity for users to withdraw or withhold consent for the collection of certain categories of data such as sensitive personal data remains severely constrained. This paper proposes that user consent at the time of registration should be reconsidered, and that there is a particular need for consent when sensitive personal data are used to personalize learning, or for purposes outside the original intention of obtaining consent. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.

How Much Randomization is Needed to Deter Collaborative Cheating on Asynchronous Exams?,2018,Full Paper,,"This paper investigates randomization on asynchronous exams as a defense against collaborative cheating. Asynchronous exams are those for which students take the exam at different times, potentially across a multi-day exam period. Collaborative cheating occurs when one student (the information producer) takes the exam early and passes information about the exam to other students (the information consumers) that are taking the exam later. Using a dataset of computerized exam and homework problems in a single course with 425 students, we identified 5.5% of students (on average) as information consumers by their disproportionate studying of problems that were on the exam. These information consumers (""cheaters"") had a significant advantage (13 percentage points on average) when every student was given the same exam problem (even when the parameters are randomized for each student), but that advantage dropped to almost negligible levels (2-3 percentage points) when students were given a random problem from a pool of two or four problems. We conclude that randomization with pools of four (or even three) problems, which also contain randomized parameters, is an effective mitigation for collaborative cheating. Our analysis suggests that this mitigation is in part explained by cheating students having less complete information about larger pools. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.

How a data-driven course planning tool affects college students’ GPA: Evidence from two field experiments,2018,Full Paper,,"College students rely on increasingly data-rich environments when making learning-relevant decisions about the courses they take and their expected time commitments. However, we know little about how their exposure to such data may influence student course choice, effort regulation, and performance.We conducteda large-scale fieldexperimentin which all the undergraduates at a large, selective university were randomized to an encouragement to use a course-planning web application that integrates information from official transcripts from the past fifteen years with detailed end-of-course evaluation surveys. We found that use of the platform lowered students' GPAby 0.28 standard deviations on average. In a subsequent field experiment, we varied access to information about course grades and time commitment on the platform and found that access to grade information in particular lowered students'overallGPA.Ourexploratory analysis suggests these effectsarenotduetochangesintheportfolioof coursesthat students choose,but ratherby changes to their behavior within courses. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.

Toward a Large-Scale Open Learning System for Data Management,2018,Short Paper - WIP mentioned,,"This paper describes ClassDB, a free and open source system to enable large-scale learning of data management. ClassDB is different from existing solutions in that the same system supports a wide range of data-management topics from introductory SQL to advanced ""native analytics"" where code in SQL and non-SQL languages (Python and R) run inside a database management system. Each student/team maintains their own sandbox which instructors can read and provide feedback. Both students and instructors can review activity logs to analyze progress and determine future course of action. ClassDB is currently in its second pilot and is scheduled for a larger trial later this year. After the trials, ClassDB will be made available to about 4,000 students in the university system, which comprises four universities and 12 community colleges. ClassDB is built in collaboration with students employing modern DevOps processes. Its source code and documentation are available in a public GitHub repository. ClassDB is work in progress. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.

Use expert knowledge instead of data – generating hints for Hour of Code exercises –,2018,Short Paper - WIP mentioned,,"Within the field of on-line tutoring systems for learning programming, such as Code.org's Hour of code, there is a trend to use previous student data to give hints. This paper shows that it is better to use expert knowledge to provide hints in environments such as Code.org's Hour of code. We present a heuristic-based approach to generating next-step hints. We use pattern matching algorithms to identify heuristics and apply each identified heuristic to an input program. We generate a next-step hint by selecting the highest scoring heuristic using a scoring function. By comparing our results with results of a previous experiment on Hour of code we show that a heuristics-based approach to providing hints gives results that are impossible to further improve. These basic heuristics are sufficient to efficiently mimic experts' next-step hints. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.

Virtualizing face-2-face trainings for training senior professionals: A Comparative Case Study on Financial Auditors,2018,Short Paper - Progress mentioned,,"Traditionally, professional learning for senior professionals is organized around face-2-face trainings. Virtual trainings seem to offer an opportunity to reduce costs related to travel and travel time. In this paper we present a comparative case study that investigates the differences between traditional face-2-face trainings in physical reality, and virtual trainings via WebEx. Our goal is to identify how the way of communication impacts interaction between trainees, between trainees and trainers, and how it impacts interruptions.

Student Trust in e-Authentication,2018,Short Paper - WIP mentioned,,"Trust is a fundamental prerequisite for the success of any technological development, especially in education. Without the trust of stakeholders, educational technologies (however effective they might be) can fail to be taken up at scale. This work-in-progress paper reports on a study that investigated the trust students have in tools developed to support e-authentication for online assessments in Higher Education. The study, part of the EU-funded TeSLA project (http://tesla-project.eu), involved almost 500 students from the Open University, UK. Students were asked their views on trust and other issues before and after they used a tool developed to authenticate student identity in online assessments. A key finding is that, after using the tools, participants marginally increased their trust in online assessments, with the majority also reporting that they also trusted how the institution would use the outcomes. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.

Transformative approaches in distance online education: aligning evidence to influence the design of teaching at scale,2018,Short Paper - WIP mentioned,,"In this paper we consider the role of sharing evidence online in work in progress to develop a new teaching framework for distance and part-time students of The Open University. The work reported here looks at the motivation for applying evidence and how it can act to support the development of the framework, rather than the framework itself. The approach described is adapted from previous research projects, and focuses on how evidence from internal and external scholarship is gathered and refined through an Evidence Hub that is shared online and open to all in the University. An aspect of the framework (offering greater continuity of study) is selected to show how the methodology applies in practice. In conclusion we highlight the value in adopting evidence-based approaches to support change processes and how sharing collective knowledge can influence decision-making. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.

Start of a Science: An Epistemological Analysis of Learning at Scale,2019,Full Paper,Broader Issues,"The Learning at Scale (L@S) conference has brought together researchers from diverse scholarly communities to design and study technologies that are explicitly meant to scale to a large number and variety of learners. Over the last three years, the L@S community has published a thematic, methodological, and bibliometric analysis to reflect on its own interests, challenges, and foundations. This paper continues the wider reflection effort and complements these two prior analyses with an epistemological analysis of the way the papers employ learning theory, evaluate evidence, and deploy statistical models. The epistemological analysis uses two methodologies: coding the full papers from the first four years for epistemological markers of interest and analyzing the network of citations from all of the full papers for dominant institutional and epistemological traditions. By combining these two methods, the present analysis reveals that most papers explicitly show their theoretical commitments, target a narrow slice of available learning theory, draw on varied academic fields in different proportions, and showcase epistemological practices in line with what philosophers of computational science observe in communities using similar model-based methods. The paper then situates these claims in wider conversations occurring in the learning sciences and philosophy of science to provide theoretical insights as well as practical recommendations for how the community can more consciously conduct and communicate its scientific endeavor. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",,,,,,100,Start of a science: An epistemological analysis of learning at scale,Johanes P.,"Johanes, Petr (55793825700)",55793825700,Start of a science: An epistemological analysis of learning at scale,2019.0,"Proceedings of the 6th 2019 ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2019",,,,,,,2.0,10.1145/3330430.3333631,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083951243&doi=10.1145%2f3330430.3333631&partnerID=40&md5=ec1892fcd57a6c9948bac5b46fedc023,"Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States","Johanes P., Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States",Bibliometrics; Citation Network Analysis; Epistemology; Knowledge Modeling; MOOCs; Online Learning; Philosophy of Science,Computation theory; Philosophical aspects; Bibliometrics; Citation networks; Epistemology; Knowledge model; MOOCs; Online learning; Philosophy of science; Learning systems,,,,,,,"Bang M., Medin D.L., Atran S., Cultural mosaics and mental models of nature, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 104, 35, pp. 13868-13874, (2007); Boaler J., Mathematics from another world: Traditional communities and the alienation of learners, The Journal of Mathematical Behavior, 18, 4, pp. 379-397, (2000); Botelho A., Wan H., Heffernan N., The prediction of student first response using prerequisite skills, Proceedings of the Second (2015) ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale - L@S’15, pp. 39-45, (2015); Bransford J., Vye N., Stevens R., Kuhl P., Schwartz D., Bell P., Meltzoff A., Barron B., Pea R.D., Reeves B., Learning Theories and Education: Toward A Decade of Synergy, (2005); Champaign J., Colvin K.F., Liu A., Fredericks C., Seaton D., Pritchard D.E., Correlating skill and improvement in 2 MOOCs with a student’s time on tasks, Proceedings of the First ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale Conference - L@S’14, pp. 11-20, (2014); Chen G., Davis D., Hauff C., Houben G.-J., Learning transfer: Does it take place in MOOCs?

Can a diversity statement increase diversity in MOOCs?,2019,Full Paper,Broader Issues,"Despite the fact that anyone can sign up for open online courses, their enrollment patterns reflect the historical underrepresentation of certain sociodemographic groups (e.g. women in STEM disciplines). We theorize that enrollment choices online are shaped by contextual cues that activate stereotypes about numeric representation and climate in brick-and-mortar institutions. A longitudinal matched-pairs experiment with 14 MOOCs (N=29,000) tested this theory by manipulating the presence of a diversity statement on course pages and measuring effects on who enrolls. We found a 3% increase in the proportion of students with lower socioeconomic status. The effect size varied across courses between -0.5 and 7 percentage points. No significant changes in enrollment patterns by gender, age, and national development level occurred. Implications for the use and content of diversity statements and their alternatives are discussed. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Multiplatform MOOC Analytics: Comparing Global and Regional Patterns in edX and Edraak,2019,Full Paper,Broader Issues,"While global massive open online course (MOOC) providers such as edX, Coursera, and FutureLearn have garnered the bulk of attention from researchers and the popular press, MOOCs are also provisioned by a series of regional providers, who are often using the Open edX platform. We leverage the data infrastructure shared by the main edX instance and one regional Open edX provider, Edraak in Jordan, to compare the experience of learners from Arab countries on both platforms. Comparing learners from Arab countries on edX to those on Edraak, the Edraak population has a more even gender balance, more learners with lower education levels, greater participation from more developing countries, higher levels of persistence and completion, and a larger total population of learners. This “apples to apples” comparison of MOOC learners is facilitated by an approach to multiplatform MOOC analytics, which employs parallel research processes to create joint aggregate datasets without sharing identifiable data across institutions. Our findings suggest that greater research attention should be paid towards regional MOOC providers, and regional providers may have an important role to play in expanding access to higher education. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

On the Acceptance and Usefulness of Personalized Learning Objectives in MOOCs,2019,Full Paper,Broader Issues,"With Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) the number of people having access to higher education increased rapidly. The intentions to enroll for a specific course vary significantly and depend on one’s professional or personal learning needs and interests. All learners have in common that they pursue their individual learning objectives. However, predominant MOOC platforms follow a one-size-fits-all approach and primarily aim for completion with certification. Specifically, technical support for goal-oriented and self-regulated learning to date is very limited in this context although both learning strategies are proven to be key factors for students’ achievement in large-scale online learning environments. In this first investigation, a concept for the application and technical integration of personalized learning objectives in a MOOC platform is realized and assessed. It is evaluated with a mixed-method approach. First, the learners’ acceptance is examined with a multivariate A/B test in two courses. Second, a survey was conducted to gather further feedback about the perceived usefulness, next to the acceptance. The results show a positive perception by the learners, which paves the way for future research. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Graded Team Assignments in MOOCs - Effects of Team Composition and Further Factors on Team Dropout Rates and Performance,2019,Full Paper,Engagement,"The ability to work in teams is an important skill in today’s work environments. In MOOCs, however, team work, team tasks, and graded team-based assignments play only a marginal role. To close this gap, we have been exploring ways to integrate graded team-based assignments in MOOCs. Some goals of our work are to determine simple criteria to match teams in a volatile environment and to enable a frictionless online collaboration for the participants within our MOOC platform. The high dropout rates in MOOCs pose particular challenges for team work in this context. By now, we have conducted 15 MOOCs containing graded team-based assignments in a variety of topics. The paper at hand presents a study that aims to establish a solid understanding of the participants in the team tasks. Furthermore, we attempt to determine which team compositions are particularly successful. Finally, we examine how several modifications to our platform’s collaborative toolset have affected the dropout rates and performance of the teams. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

How Learners Engage with In-Context Retrieval Exercises in Online Informational Videos,2019,Full Paper,Engagement,"Learners increasingly refer to online videos for learning new technical concepts, but often overlook or forget key details. We investigated how retrieval practice, a learning strategy commonly used in education, could be designed to reinforce key concepts in online videos. We began with a formative study to understand users’ perceptions of cued and free-recall retrieval techniques. We next designed a new in-context flashcard-based technique that provides expert-curated retrieval exercises in context of a video’s playback. We evaluated this technique with 14 learners and investigated how learners engage with flashcards that are prompted automatically at predefined intervals or flashcards that appear on-demand. Our results overall showed that learners perceived automatically prompted flashcards to be less effortful and made the learners feel more confident about grasping key concepts in the video. However, learners found that on-demand flashcards gave them more control over their learning and allowed them to personalize their review of content. We discuss the implications of these findings for designing hybrid automatic and on-demand in-context retrieval exercises for online videos. © 2019 ACM.

"Instructors Desire Student Activity, Literacy, and Video Quality Analytics to Improve Video-based Blended Courses",2019,Full Paper,Engagement,"While video becomes increasingly prevalent in educational settings, current research has yet to investigate what feedback instructors need regarding their students’ engagement and learning despite video technologies being equipped to provide viewing analytics and collect student feedback. In this paper we investigate instructors’ requirements from video analytics. We used a Grounded Theory Approach and interviewed 16 instructors who teach using video to determine the advantages for using video in their teaching and the different requirements for analytics and feedback in their existing practice. Based on our analysis of the interviews, we found three categories of information that instructors want to inform their teaching. Instructors are looking to see if their students have watched their videos, how much they understood in those videos, and how useful the videos are to the students. These categories provide the foundations and design implications for instructor-centric educational video analytics interfaces. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Growth Mindset Predicts Student Achievement and Behavior in Mobile Learning,2019,Full Paper,Engagement,"Students’ personal qualities other than cognitive ability are known to influence persistence and achievement in formal learning environments, but the extent of their influence in digital learning environments is unclear. This research investigates non-cognitive factors in mobile learning in a resource-poor context. We surveyed 1,000 Kenyan high school students who use a popular SMS-based learning platform that provides formative assessments aligned with the national curriculum. Combining survey responses with platform interaction logs, we find growth mindset to be one of the strongest predictors of assessment scores. We investigate theory-based behavioral mechanisms to explain this relationship. Although students who hold a growth mindset are not more likely to persist after facing adversity, they spend more time on each assessment, increasing their likelihood of answering correctly. Results suggest that cultivating a growth mindset can motivate students in a resource-poor context to excel in a mobile learning environment. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Improv: Teaching Programming at Scale via Live Coding,2019,Full Paper,Domain Specific,"Computer programming instructors frequently perform live coding in settings ranging from MOOC lecture videos to online livestreams. However, there is little tool support for this mode of teaching, so presenters must now either screen-share or use generic slideshow software. To overcome the limitations of these formats, we propose that programming environments should directly facilitate live coding for education. We prototyped this idea by creating Improv, an IDE extension for preparing and delivering code-based presentations informed by Mayer’s principles of multimedia learning. Improv lets instructors synchronize blocks of code and output with slides and create preset waypoints to guide their presentations. A case study on 30 educational videos containing 28 hours of live coding showed that Improv was versatile enough to replicate approximately 96% of the content within those videos. In addition, a preliminary user study on four teaching assistants showed that Improv was expressive enough to allow them to make their own custom presentations in a variety of styles and improvise by live coding in response to simulated audience questions. Users mentioned that Improv lowered cognitive load by minimizing context switching and made it easier to fix errors on-the-fly than using slide-based presentations. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Scaffolding during Science Inquiry,2019,Full Paper,Domain Specific,"Prior studies on scaffolding for investigative inquiry practices (i.e. forming a question/hypothesis, collecting data, and analyzing and interpreting data [21]) revealed that students who received scaffolding were better able to both learn practices and transfer these competencies to new topics than were students who did not receive scaffolding. Prior studies have also shown that after removing scaffolding, students continued to demonstrate improved inquiry performance on a variety of practices across new driving questions over time. However, studies have not examined the relationship between the amount of scaffolding received and transfer of inquiry performance; this is the focus of the present study. 107 middle school students completed four virtual lab activities (i.e. driving questions) in Inq-ITS. Students received scaffolding when needed from an animated pedagogical computer agent for the first three driving questions for the Animal Cell virtual lab. Then they completed the fourth driving question without access to scaffolding in a different topic, Plant Cell. Results showed that students’ performances increased even with fewer scaffolds for the inquiry practices of hypothesizing, collecting data, interpreting data, and warranting claims; furthermore, these results were robust as evidenced by the finding that students required less scaffolding as they completed subsequent inquiry activities. These data provide evidence of near and far transfer as a result of adaptive scaffolding of science inquiry practices. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",,,,,,100,Scaffolding during science inquiry,Li H.;

Teaching UI Design at Global Scales: A Case Study of the Design of Collaborative Capstone Projects for MOOCs,2019,Full Paper,Domain Specific,"Group projects are an essential component of teaching user interface (UI) design. We identified six challenges in transferring traditional group projects into the context of Massive Open Online Courses: managing dropout, avoiding free-riding, appropriate scaffolding, cultural and time zone differences, and establishing common ground. We present a case study of the design of a group project for a UI Design MOOC, in which we implemented technical tools and social structures to cope with the above challenges. Based on survey analysis, interviews, and team chat data from the students over a six-month period, we found that our socio-technical design addressed many of the obstacles that MOOC learners encountered during remote collaboration. We translate our findings into design implications for better group learning experiences at scale. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Inequality: multi-modal equation entry on the web,2019,Full Paper,Domain Specific,"Online learning in STEM subjects requires an easy way to enter and automatically mark mathematical equations. Existing solutions did not meet our requirements, and therefore we developed Inequality, a new open-source system which works across all major browsers, supports both mouse and touch-based entry, and is usable by high school children and teachers. Inequality has been in use for over 2 years by about 20 000 students and nearly 900 teachers as part of the Isaac online learning platform. In this paper we evaluate Inequality as an entry method, assess the flexibility of our approach, and the effect the system has on student behaviour. We prepared 343 questions which could be answered using either Inequality or a traditional method. Looking across over 472 000 question attempts, we found that students were equally proficient at answering questions correctly with both entry methods. Moreover, students using Inequality required fewer attempts to arrive at the correct answer 73% of the time. In a detailed analysis of equation construction, we found that Inequality provides significant flexibility in the construction of mathematical expressions, accommodating different working styles. We expected students who first worked on paper before entering their answers would require fewer attempts than those who did not, however this was not the case (p = 0.0109). While our system is clearly usable, a user survey highlighted a number of issues which we have addressed in a subsequent update. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Automatic Assessment of Complex Assignments using Topic Models,2019,Full Paper,Assessment,"Automated assessment of complex assignments is crucial for scaling up learning of complex skills such as critical thinking. To address this challenge, one previous work has applied supervised machine learning to automate the assessment by learning from examples of graded assignments by humans. However, in the previous work, only simple lexical features, such as words or n-grams, have been used. In this paper, we propose to use topics as features for this task, which are more interpretable than those simple lexical features and can also address polysemy and synonymy of lexical semantics. The topics can be learned automatically from the student assignment data by using a probabilistic topic model. We propose and study multiple approaches to construct topical features and to combine topical features with simple lexical features. We evaluate the proposed methods using clinical case assignments performed by veterinary medicine students. The experimental results show that topical features are generally very effective and can substantially improve performance when added on top of the lexical features. However, their effectiveness is highly sensitive to how the topics are constructed and a combination of topics constructed using multiple views of the text data works the best. Our results also show that combining the prediction results of using different types of topical features and of topical and lexical features is more effective than pooling all features together to form a larger feature space. © 2019 ACM.

Designing Digital Peer Assessment for Second Language Learning in Low Resource Learning Settings,2019,Full Paper,Assessment,"In low-resource, over-burdened schools and learning centres, peer assessment systems promise significant practical and pedagogical benefits. Many of the these benefits have been realised in contexts like massive open online courses (MOOCs) and university classrooms which share a specific trait with low-resource schools: high learner-teacher ratios. However, the constraints and considerations for designing and deploying peer assessment systems in low-resource classrooms have not been well-researched and understood, especially for high school. In this paper, we present the design of a peer assessment system for second language learning (English as a Second Language) for high school learners in South Africa. We report findings from multiple studies investigating qualitative and quantitative aspects of peer review, as well as the contextual factors that influence the viability of peer assessment systems in these contexts. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",,,,,,100,Designing digital peer assessment for second language learning in low resource learning settings,Molapo M.;

Mining Students Pre-instruction Beliefs for Improved Learning,2019,Full Paper,Assessment,"In principle, learning can be increased by assessing the detailed state of student knowledge and mistaken knowledge with a pre-test and then optimizing instruction as measured by the post-test score. As a first step in this direction, we applied a Multidimensional Item Response Theory (MIRT) to 17,000 pre-instruction administrations of the Force Concept Inventory (FCI) to study students’ initial knowledge in detail. Examination of Item Response Curves (IRCs) showed that even students scoring below chance are not randomly guessing, but instead preferentially select only one or two distractors. Two dimensional IRT applied to the entire set of 150 possible responses, rather than applied dichotomously to the thirty questions, revealed two skill dimensions of comparable variance. Perpendicular directions were identified within this space corresponding to Newtonian ability and propensity to select responses whose IRC’s have a maximum at intermediate Newtonian ability rather than at the top of bottom of this dimension. These intermediate responses corresponded to known pre-Newtonian ideas, particularly the Medieval concept of impetus.

Scaling Up Writing in the Curriculum: Batch Mode Active Learning for Automated Essay Scoring,2019,Full Paper,Assessment,"Automated essay scoring (AES) allows writing to be assigned in large courses and can provide instant formative feedback to students. However, creating models for AES can be costly, requiring the collection and human scoring of hundreds of essays. We have developed and are piloting a web-based tool that allows instructors to incrementally score responses to enable AES scoring while minimizing the number of essays the instructors must score. Previous work has shown that techniques from the machine learning subfield of active learning can reduce the amount of training data required to create effective AES models. We extend those results to a less idealized scenario: one driven by the instructor’s need to score sets of essays, in which the model is trained iteratively using batch mode active learning. We propose a novel approach inspired by a class of topological methods, but with reduced computational requirements, which we refer to as topological maxima. Using actual student data, we show that batch mode active learning is a practical approach to training AES models. Finally, we discuss implications of using this technology for automated customized scoring of writing across the curriculum. © 2019 ACM.

UpGrade: Sourcing Student Open-Ended Solutions to Create Scalable Learning Opportunities,2019,Full Paper,Learning Support,"In schools and colleges around the world, open-ended homework assignments are commonly used. However, such assignments require substantial instructor effort for grading, and tend not to support opportunities for repeated practice. We propose UpGrade, a novel learnersourcing approach that generates scalable learning opportunities using prior student solutions to open-ended problems. UpGrade creates interactive questions that offer automated and real-time feedback, while enabling repeated practice. In a two-week experiment in a college-level HCI course, students answering UpGrade-created questions instead of traditional open-ended assignments achieved indistinguishable learning outcomes in ~30% less time. Further, no manual grading effort is required. To enhance quality control, UpGrade incorporates a psychometric approach using crowd workers’ answers to automatically prune out low quality questions, resulting in a question bank that exceeds reliability standards for classroom use. © 2019 ACM.

Two views of scale: Design Principles for Scaling Reach and Empowerment,2019,Full Paper,Learning Support,"How do we design technology for learning at scale? Based on an examination of a large number of influential systems for learning at scale, I argue that designing for scale is not an amorphous design undertaking. Instead, it builds on two distinct perspectives on scale. Systems built with a scaling through efficiency perspective make learning more efficient and allow the same number of instructors to help a much larger set of learners. Systems with a scaling through empowerment perspective empower a larger number of people to assist learners effectively. I outline how these simple differences in design perspective lead to large differences in design concerns, techniques, and evaluation criteria. Articulating prevalent design perspectives should make overlooked design opportunities more salient, help systems designers design for scale more deliberately and understand their tradeoffs, and open up new opportunities to designers who shift their perspectives. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Apples to Apples: Differences in Viewer Retention When Longer Content is Chopped into Smaller Bites,2019,Full Paper,Learning Support,"Numerous studies have concluded that viewer retention decreases as video length increases. However, we are not aware of any prior work in which a set of longer MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) videos are compared with the same content split into multiple shorter videos. We are fortunate to be in the unique position to have two separate MOOCs that teach essentially the same content using two different platforms (the LEGO Mindstorms NXT and EV3 robots). In our NXT MOOC, videos are quite long, with over 20% of the videos having a running time of more than ten minutes. The EV3 MOOC has very similar content; EV3 MOOC scripts were written by modifying NXT scripts as appropriate. However, many of the EV3 lessons were split into two or three shorter videos in place of a single longer one. NXT videos that are very close in terms of both content and duration to EV3 videos have similar average percentage viewed. This suggests that the two populations watching the videos are similar and that we have a promising setup for analyzing the relationship between NXT lessons whose EV3 counterparts consist of multiple shorter videos. We present an analysis of our data, along with various interpretations some, but not all, of which support the “shorter videos are better” hypothesis. © 2019 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

Key Phrase Extraction for Generating Educational Question-Answer Pairs,2019,Full Paper,Learning Support,"Automatic question generation is a promising tool for developing the learning systems of the future. Research in this area has mostly relied on having answers (key phrases) identified beforehand and given as a feature, which is not practical for real-world, scalable applications of question generation. We describe and implement an end-to-end neural question generation system that generates question and answer pairs given a context paragraph only. We accomplish this by first generating answer candidates (key phrases) from the paragraph context, and then generating questions using the key phrases. We evaluate our method of key phrase extraction by comparing our output over the same paragraphs with question-answer pairs generated by crowdworkers and by educational experts. Results demonstrate that our system is able to generate educationally meaningful question and answer pairs with only context paragraphs as input, significantly increasing the potential scalability of automatic question generation. © 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Master’s at Scale: Five Years in a Scalable Online Graduate Degree,2019,Full Paper,L@S Perspectives,"In 2014, Georgia Tech launched the first for-credit MOOC-based graduate degree program. In the five years since, the program has proven generally successful, enrolling over 14,000 unique students, and several other similar programs have followed in its footsteps. Existing research on the program has focused largely on details of individual classes; program-level research, however, has been scarce. In this paper, we delve into the program-level details of an at-scale Master’s degree, from the story of its creation through the data generated by the program, including the numbers of applications, admissions, matriculations, and graduations; enrollment details including demographic information and retention patterns; trends in student grades and experience as compared to the on-campus student body; and alumni perceptions. Among our findings, we note that the program has stabilized at a retention rate of around 70%; that the program’s growth has not slowed; that the program has not cannibalized its on-campus counterpart; and that the program has seen an upward trend in the number of women enrolled as well as a persistently higher number of underrepresented minorities than the on-campus program. Throughout this analysis, we abstract out distinct lessons that should inform the development and growth of similar programs. © 2019 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

Data-Assistive Course-to-Course Articulation Using Machine Translation,2019,Full Paper,L@S Perspectives,"Higher education at scale, such as in the California public post-secondary system, has promoted upward socioeconomic mobility by supporting student transfer from 2-year community colleges to 4-year degree granting universities. Among the barriers to transfer is earning enough credit at 2-year institutions that qualify for the transfer credit required by 4-year degree programs. Defining which course at one institution will count as credit for an equivalent course at another institution is called course articulation, and it is an intractable task when attempting to manually articulate every set of courses at every institution with one another. In this paper, we present a methodology towards making tractable this process of defining and maintaining articulations by leveraging the information contained within historic enrollment patterns and course catalog descriptions. We provide a proof-of-concept analysis using data from a 4-year and 2-year institution to predict articulation pairs between them, produced from machine translation models and validated by a set of 65 institutionally pre-established course-to-course articulations. Finally, we create a report of proposed articulations for consumption by the institutions and close with a discussion of limitations and the challenges to adoption. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Predict and Intervene: Addressing the Dropout Problem in a MOOC-based Program,2019,Full Paper,L@S Perspectives,"Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are an efficient way of delivering knowledge to thousands of learners. However, even among learners who show a clear intention to complete a MOOC, the dropout rate is substantial. This is particularly relevant in the context of MOOC-based educational programs where a funnel of participation can be observed and high dropout rates at early stages of the program significantly reduce the number of learners successfully completing it. In this paper, we propose an approach to identify learners at risk of dropping out from a course, and we design and test an intervention intended to mitigate that risk. We collect course clickstream data from MOOCs of the MITx MicroMasters® in Supply Chain Management program and apply machine learning algorithms to predict potential dropouts. Our final model is able to predict 80% of actual dropouts. Based on these results, we design an intervention aimed to increase learners’ motivation and engagement with a MOOC. The intervention consists on sending tailored encouragement emails to at-risk learners, but despite the high email opening rate, it shows no effect in dropout reduction. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Chimeria:Grayscale MOOC: Towards Critical Self-Reflection at Scale,2019,WIP,,"Contemporary online learning systems are increasingly common elements of post-secondary, workplace, and lifelong education. These systems typically employ the transmission model of education to teach students, an approach ill-suited for fostering deeper learning. This paper presents our latest findings related to ongoing research developing a generalizable framework for supporting deeper learning in online learning systems. In this work, we focus on the self-debriefing component of our framework and its impact on deeper learning in online learning systems. To pursue this line of inquiry, we conducted an exploratory study evaluating the Chimeria:Grayscale MOOC, an online learning system that implements our framework. Our results suggest that self-debriefing is crucial for effectively supporting students’ reflections. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",,,,,,99,Chimeria: Grayscale MOOC: Towards critical self-reflection at scale,Ortiz P.; Harrell D.F.,"Ortiz, Pablo (57195131530); Harrell, D.

Measuring Students’ Performance on Programming Tasks,2019,WIP,,"Large scale learning systems for introductory programming need to be able to automatically assess the quality of students’ performance on programming tasks. This assessment is done using a performance measure, which provides feedback to students and teachers, and an input to the domain, student and tutor models. The choice of a good performance measure is nontrivial, since the performance of students can be measured in many ways, and the design of measure can interact with the adaptive features of a learning system or imperfections in the used domain model. We discuss the important design decisions and illustrate the process of an iterative design and evaluation of a performance measure in a case study. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",,,,,,100,Measuring students’ performance on programming tasks,Effenberger T.; Pelánek R.,"Effenberger, Tomáš (57203400352); Pelánek, Radek (8961121100)",57203400352; 8961121100,Measuring students’ performance on programming tasks,2019.0,"Proceedings of the 6th 2019 ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2019",,,,,,,2.0,10.1145/3330430.3333639,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083951086&doi=10.1145%2f3330430.3333639&partnerID=40&md5=fb956459af76725168868d67a5dd8545,"Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic","Effenberger T., Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic; Pelánek R., Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic",,Students; Adaptive features; Design decisions; Feedback to students; Introductory programming; Iterative design; Large-scale learning; Performance measure; Programming tasks; Learning systems,,,,,,,"Effenberger T., Pelanek R., Towards making block-based programming activities adaptive, Proc.

BookBuddy: Turning Digital Materials Into Interactive Foreign Language Lessons Through a Voice Chatbot,2019,WIP,,"Digitization of education has brought a tremendous amount of online materials that are potentially useful for language learners to practice their reading skills. However, these digital materials rarely help with conversational practice, a key component of foreign language learning. Leveraging recent advances in chatbot technologies, we developed BookBuddy, a scalable virtual reading companion that can turn any reading material into an interactive conversation-based English lesson. We piloted our virtual tutor with five 6-year-old native Chinese-speaking children currently learning English. Preliminary results suggest that children enjoyed speaking English with our virtual tutoring chatbot and were highly engaged during the interaction. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",,,,,,100,Bookbuddy: Turning digital materials into interactive foreign language lessons through a voice chatbot,Ruan S.; Willis A.; Xu Q.; Davis G.M.; Jiang L.; Brunskill E.; Landay J.A.,"Ruan, Sherry (57203394018); Willis, Angelica (57210729690); Xu, Qianyao (54794528100); Davis, Glenn M.

Creating a Framework for User-Centered Development and Improvement of Digital Education,2019,WIP,,"We investigate how the technology acceptance and learning experience of the digital education platform HPI Schul-Cloud (HPI School Cloud) for German secondary school teachers can be improved by proposing a user-centered research and development framework. We highlight the importance of developing digital learning technologies in a user-centered way to take differences in the requirements of educators and students into account. We suggest applying qualitative and quantitative methods to build a solid understanding of a learning platform’s users, their needs, requirements, and their context of use. After concept development and idea generation of features and areas of opportunity based on the user research, we emphasize on the application of a multi-attribute utility analysis decision-making framework to prioritize ideas rationally, taking results of user research into account. Afterward, we recommend applying the principle build-learn-iterate to build prototypes in different resolutions while learning from user tests and improving the selected opportunities.

Leveraging Skill Hierarchy for Multi-Level Modeling with Elo Rating System,2019,WIP,,"In this paper, we are discussing the case of offering retired assessment items as practice problems for the purposes of learning in a system called ACT Academy. In contrast to computer-assisted learning platforms, where students consistently focus on small sets of skills they practice till mastery, in our case, students are free to explore the whole subject domain. As a result, they have significantly lower attempt counts per individual skill. We have developed and evaluated a student modeling approach that differs from traditional approaches to modeling skill acquisition by leveraging the hierarchical relations in the skill taxonomy used for indexing practice problems. Results show that when applied in systems like ACT Academy, this approach offers significant improvements in terms of predicting student performance. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",,,,,,100,Leveraging skill hierarchy for multi-level modeling with ELO rating system,Yudelson M.; Rosen Y.; Polyak S.; De la Torre J.,"Yudelson, Michael (55920072000); Rosen, Yigal (18042058000); Polyak, Steve (57197858160); De la Torre, Jimmy (22940257400)",55920072000; 18042058000; 57197858160; 22940257400,Leveraging skill hierarchy for multi-level modeling with ELO rating system,2019.0,"Proceedings of the 6th 2019 ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2019",,,,,,,4.0,10.1145/3330430.3333645,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083953183&doi=10.1145%2f3330430.3333645&partnerID=40&md5=9cfbfd0e9b28605120ecccbaaa80febf,"ACT, Inc., Iowa City, IA, United States; University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong","Yudelson M., ACT, Inc., Iowa City, IA, United States; Rosen Y., ACT, Inc., Iowa City, IA, United States; Polyak S., ACT, Inc., Iowa City, IA, United States; De la Torre J., University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong",Assessment; Multi-level modeling; Online learning; Skill acquisition,Computer aided instruction; E-learning; Learning systems; Assessment; Computer assisted learning; Hierarchical relations; Multilevel model; Online learning; Skill acquisition; Student performance; Traditional approaches; Students,,,,,,,"Camara W., O'Connor R., Mattern K., Hanson M.A., Beyond academics: A holistic framework for enhancing education and workplace success, ACT Research Report Series, 2015, 4, (2015); Elo A.E., The Rating of Chess Players, Past and Present, (1978); Grihak J., Pelanek R., Niznan J., Student models for prior knowledge estimation, International Conference on Educational Data Mining (EDM 2015), pp. 109-116, (2015); Corbett A.T., Anderson J.R., Knowledge tracing: Modeling the acquisition of procedural knowledge, User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction, 4, 4, pp. 253-278, (1995); De la Torre J., Sun Y., The accordion procedure: A method for accommodating a large number of attributes in cognitive diagnosis modeling, Poster Presentation at the Annual Educational Technology and Computational Psychometrics Symposium, (2018); Alpaydm E., Combined 5x2 CV F-test for comparing supervised classification learning algorithms, NComputationtation, 11, 8, pp. 1885-1892, (1999); Khajah M., Lindsey R.V., Mozer M., How deep is knowledge tracing?, Proceedings of International Conference on Educational Data Mining, pp. 94-101, (2016)",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,"6th ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2019",24 June 2019 through 25 June 2019,Chicago,150183.0,,978-145036804-9,,,English,"Proc.

Student Code Trajectories in an Introductory Programming MOOC,2019,WIP,,"In classrooms, instructors teaching students how to code have the ability to monitor progress and provide feedback through regular interaction. There is generally no analogous tracing of learning progression in programming MOOCs, hindering the ability of MOOC platforms to provide automated feedback at scale. We explore features for every certified student’s history of code submissions to specific problems in a programming MOOC and measure similarity to sample solutions. We seek to understand whether students who succeed in the course reach solutions similar to these instructor-intended sample solutions, in terms of the concepts and mechanisms they contain. Furthermore, do students learn to conform to instructor expectations as the course progresses, and does prior experience have correlations with student behavior? We also explore what feature representations are sufficient for code submission history, since they are directly applicable to the development of automated tutors for progress tracking.

Predicting the difficulty of automatic item generators on exams from their difficulty on homeworks,2019,WIP,,"To design good assessments, it is useful to have an estimate of the difficulty of a novel exam question before running an exam. In this paper, we study a collection of a few hundred automatic item generators (short computer programs that generate a variety of unique item instances) and show that their exam difficulty can be roughly predicted from student performance on the same generator during pre-exam practice. Specifically, we show that the rate that students correctly respond to a generator on an exam is on average within 5% of the correct rate for those students on their last practice attempt.

Pilot Study to Estimate “Difficult” Area in e-Learning Material by Physiological Measurements,2019,WIP,,"To improve designs of e-learning materials, it is necessary to know which word or figure a learner felt ""difficult"" in the materials. In this pilot study, we measured electroencephalography (EEG) and eye gaze data of learners and analyzed to estimate which area they had difficulty to learn. The developed system realized simultaneous measurements of physiological data and subjective evaluations during learning. Using this system, we observed specific EEG activity in difficult pages. Integrating of eye gaze and EEG measurements raised a possibility to determine where a learner felt “difficult” in a page of learning materials. From these results, we could suggest that the multimodal measurements of EEG and eye gaze would lead to effective improvement of learning materials. For future study, more data collection using various materials and learners with different backgrounds is necessary. This study could lead to establishing a method to improve e-learning materials based on learners' mental states. © 2019 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).",,,,,,100,Pilot study to estimate “difficult” area in e-learning material by physiological measurements,Tamura K.; Okamoto T.; Oi M.; Shimada A.; Hatano K.; Yamada M.; Lu M.; Konomi S.,"Tamura, Kaori (55625286500); Okamoto, Tsuyoshi (55910998100); Oi, Misato (23498425900); Shimada, Atsushi (57222646656); Hatano, Kohei (14021639200); Yamada, Masanori (35191391300); Lu, Min (55791872200); Konomi, Shin'ichi (23389685300)",55625286500; 55910998100; 23498425900; 57222646656; 14021639200; 35191391300; 55791872200; 23389685300,Pilot study to estimate “difficult” area in e-learning material by physiological measurements,2019.0,"Proceedings of the 6th 2019 ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2019",,,,,,,1.0,10.1145/3330430.3333648,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083951407&doi=10.1145%2f3330430.3333648&partnerID=40&md5=7c91990d5f60f7067779674cbd87fefc,"Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan","Tamura K., Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan; Okamoto T., Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan; Oi M., Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan; Shimada A., Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan; Hatano K., Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan; Yamada M., Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan; Lu M., Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan; Konomi S., Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan",EEG; Eye tracking; Learning materials; Multimodal sensing,E-learning; Electroencephalography; Electrophysiology; Eye tracking; Felt; E-learning materials; Learning materials; Multi-modal measurement; Multi-modal sensing; Physiological data; Physiological measurement; Simultaneous measurement; Subjective evaluations; Learning systems,,,,,"JST Mirai, (17-171024547)","This work was supported by JST Mirai Grant Number 17-171024547, Japan.","Alemdag E., Cagiltay K., A systematic review of eye tracking research on multimedia learning, Computers & Education, 125, pp. 413-428, (2018); Boucheix J.M., Lowe R.K., An eye tracking comparison of external pointing cues and internal continuous cues in learning with complex animations, Learning and Instruction, 20, 2, pp. 123-135, (2010); Dalmaijer E.S., Mathot S., Van der Stigchel S., PyGaze: An open-source, cross-platform toolbox for minimal-effort programming of eyetracking experiments, Behavior Research Methods, 46, 4, pp. 913-921, (2014); Delorme A., Makeig S., EEGLAb: An open source toolbox for analysis of single-trial EEG dynamics including independent component analysis, Journal of Neuroscience Methods, 134, 1, pp. 9-21, (2004); Jarodzka H., Holmqvist K., Gruber H., Eye tracking in Educational Science: Theoretical frameworks and research agendas, Journal of Eye Movement Research, 10, (2017); Kleiner M., Brainard D., Pelli D., Ingling A., Murray R., Broussard C., What’s new in psychtoolbox-3, Perception, 36, 14, pp. 1-16, (2007); De Koning B.B., Tabbers H.K., Rikers R.M.J.P., Paas F., Attention guidance in learning from a complex animation: Seeing is understanding?, Learning and Instruction, 20, 2, pp. 111-122, (2010); Ku Y., Hong B., Gao X., Gao S., Spectra-temporal patterns underlying mental addition: An ERP and ERD/ERS study, Neuroscience Letters, 472, 1, pp. 5-10, (2010); Lindner M.A., Eitel A., Strobel B., Koller O., Identifying processes underlying the multimedia effect in testing: An eye-movement analysis, Learning and Instruction, 47, pp. 91-102, (2017); Wu C.-H., Huang Y.-M., Hwang J.-P., Review of affective computing in education/learning: Trends and challenges, British Journal of Educational Technology, 47, 6, pp. 1304-1323, (2016)",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,"6th ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2019",24 June 2019 through 25 June 2019,Chicago,150183.0,,978-145036804-9,,,English,"Proc.

Semantic Matching Evaluation of User Responses to Electronics Questions in AutoTutor,2019,WIP,,"Relatedness between user input and an ideal response is a salient feature required for proper functioning of an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) using natural language processing. Improper assessment of text input causes maladaptation in ITSs. Meta-assessment of user responses in ITSs can improve instruction efficacy and user satisfaction. Therefore, this paper evaluates the quality of semantic matching between user input and the expected response in AutoTutor, an ITS which holds a conversation with the user in natural language. AutoTutor’s dialogue is driven by the AutoTutor Conversation Engine (ACE), which combines Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Regular Expressions (RegEx) to assess user input. We assessed ACE via responses from 219 Amazon Mechanical Turk users, who answered 118 electronics questions broken into 5202 response pairings (n = 5202). These analyses explore the relationship between RegEx and LSA, agreement between the two judges, and agreement between human judges and ACE. Additionally, we calculated precision and recall. As expected, regular expressions and LSA had a moderate, positive relationship, and agreement between ACE and humans was fair, but slightly lower than agreement between humans. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Proposal and Implementation of an Elderly-oriented User Interface for Learning Support Systems,2019,WIP,,"Extended learning support systems for all-age education requires inclusive user interface design, especially for elderly users. A dual-tablet user interface with simplified visual layers and more intuitive operations was proposed aiming to reduce the physical and mental loads of elderly learners. An initial prototype with basic functions of viewing learning material was developed based on a cross-platform framework. Two preliminary user experiments participated by elderly volunteers were carried out for formative evaluations, in order to improve the usability of the interface design iteratively. The prototype was modified based on the participants’ comments and observation of their operations during the experiments. Additional findings of the elderly users’ preference and tendency were discussed for further development. © 2019 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).",,,,,,100,Proposal and implementation of an elderly-oriented user interface for learning support systems,Lu M.; Tamura K.; Okamoto T.; Oi M.; Shimada A.; Hatano K.; Yamada M.; Konomi S.,"Lu, Min (55791872200); Tamura, Kaori (55625286500); Okamoto, Tsuyoshi (55910998100); Oi, Misato (23498425900); Shimada, Atsushi (57222646656); Hatano, Kohei (14021639200); Yamada, Masanori (35191391300); Konomi, Shin'ichi (23389685300)",55791872200; 55625286500; 55910998100; 23498425900; 57222646656; 14021639200; 35191391300; 23389685300,Proposal and implementation of an elderly-oriented user interface for learning support systems,2019.0,"Proceedings of the 6th 2019 ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2019",,,,,,,0.0,10.1145/3330430.3333650,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083953711&doi=10.1145%2f3330430.3333650&partnerID=40&md5=97b22c7ea1b7330956f17340c2c3ae70,"Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan","Lu M., Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan; Tamura K., Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan; Okamoto T., Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan; Oi M., Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan; Shimada A., Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan; Hatano K., Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan; Yamada M., Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan; Konomi S., Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan",All-age learning; E-learning; Inclusive design; Learning support system; Older adults; User interface,E-learning; Learning systems; All-age learning; Formative evaluation; Inclusive design; Intuitive operations; Learning materials; Learning support systems; Older adults; User interface designs; User interfaces,,,,,"JST Mirai, (17-171024547)","This work was supported by JST Mirai Grant Number 17-171024547, Japan.","Al-Razgan M.S., Al-Khalifa H.S., Al-Shahrani M.D., Et al., Touch-Based Mobile Phone Interface Guidelines and Design Recommendations for Elderly People: A Survey of the Literature, pp. 568-574, (2012); Farage M.A., Miller K.W., Ajayi F., Hutchins D., Design principles to accommodate older adults, Glob J Health Sci, 4, 2, pp. 2-25, (2012); Konomi S., Hatano K., Inaba M., Et al., Towards Supporting Multigenerational Co-creation and Social Activities: Extending learning analytics platforms and beyond, International Conference on Distributed, Ambient, and Pervasive Interactions, pp. 82-91, (2018); Leung R., McGrenere J., Graf P., Age-related differences in the initial usability of mobile device icons, Behaviour & Information Technology, 30, 5, pp. 629-642, (2011); Morris J.M., User-interface design for older adults, Interacting with Computers, 6, 4, pp. 373-393, (1994)",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,"6th ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2019",24 June 2019 through 25 June 2019,Chicago,150183.0,,978-145036804-9,,,English,"Proc.

On the Influence of Grades on Learning Behavior of Students in MOOCs,2019,WIP,,"MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) frequently use grades to calculate whether a student passes the course. To better understand how student behavior is influenced by grade feedback, we conduct a study on the changes of certified students’ behavior before and after they have received their grade. We use observational student data from two MITx MOOCs to examine student behavior before and after a grade is released and calculate the difference (the delta-activity). We then analyze the changes in the delta-activity distributions across all graded assignments a we observe that the variation in delta-activity decreases as grade decreases, with students who have the lowest grade exhibiting little or no change in weekly activity. This trend persists throughout each course, in all course offerings, suggesting that a change in grade does not correlate with a change in the behavior of certified MOOC students.

Synchronous at Scale: Investigation and Implementation of a Semi-Synchronous Online Lecture Platform,2019,WIP,,"Online classes and degree programs continue to grow in popularity, in part due to the increased convenience and accessibility of education that technology has provided in recent years. As online education scales upwards and outwards, there is an increased need to provide students with an engaging and collaborative learning experience. In some online learning environments, student collaboration is perceived to be more difficult than it is in a physical classroom setting due to cultural or geographic distance between students. In particular, online class lectures often lack the collaborative spirit seen in most in-person classroom lectures.

Impact of Free-Certificate Coupons on Learner Behavior in Online Courses: Results from Two Case Studies,2019,WIP,,"The relationship between pricing and learning behavior is an increasingly important topic in MOOC (massive open online course) research. We report on two case studies where cohorts of learners were offered coupons for free-certificates to explore price reductions might influence user behavior in MOOC-based online learning settings. In Case Study #1, we compare participation and certification rates between courses with and without coupons for free-certificates. In the courses with a free-certificate track, participants signed up for the verified certificate track at higher rates and completion rates among verified students were higher than in the paid-certificate track courses. In Case Study #2, we compare the behaviors of learners within the same courses based on whether they received access to a free-certificate track. Access to free-certificates was associated with somewhat lower certification rates, but overall certification rates remained high particularly among those who viewed the courses. These findings suggests that some other incentives, other than simply the sunk-cost of paying for a verified certificate-track, may motivate learners to complete MOOC courses. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Guided-KNOWLA: The Use of Guided Unscrambling to Enhance Active Online Learning,2019,WIP,,"Test-yourself questions are effective examples of formative assessment, and have been shown to promote learners’ active interaction with materials and knowledge mastery through frequent practice. However, the cost of developing and implementing engaging test-yourself activities can be problematic in large-scale web-based learning environments; a lack of built-in scaffolding to guide learners is also a challenge. We introduce Guided-KNOWLA, an improvement of KNOWLA – a learning tool has learners assemble a given set of mixed-size scrambled fragments into a logical order using a web-based interface, accompanied by motivational step-by-step hint/guidance as enhancements. We conducted an exploratory study with graduate learners to examine their attitudes toward Guided-KNOWLA activities, measured by perceived usefulness and comparative formats for formative assessment. Preliminary results suggest that using the Guided-KNOWLA were useful in helping learners master online materials and were a preferred format of “test-yourself” practice to multiple-choice questions. © 2019 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).",,,,,,100,Guided-Knowla: The use of guided unscrambling to enhance active online learning,Braude E.; Liu Y.,"Braude, Eric (6603177288); Liu, Ye (57210736214)",6603177288; 57210736214,Guided-Knowla: The use of guided unscrambling to enhance active online learning,2019.0,"Proceedings of the 6th 2019 ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2019",,,,,,,0.0,10.1145/3330430.3333655,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083952322&doi=10.1145%2f3330430.3333655&partnerID=40&md5=a0342e63c9b6b9bdf2dd1d4364ede05f,"Computer Science Department Metropolitan College, Boston University, Boston, United States; Office of Distance Education Metropolitan College, Boston University, Boston, United States","Braude E., Computer Science Department Metropolitan College, Boston University, Boston, United States; Liu Y., Office of Distance Education Metropolitan College, Boston University, Boston, United States",Active Learning; Formative assessment; MOOC; Scaffolding; Test-yourself practice; Web-based learning,Computer aided instruction; Multimedia systems; Scaffolds; Websites; Active Learning; Formative assessment; MOOC; Scaffolding; Web based learning; E-learning,,,,,,,"Ambrose S.A., Bridges M.W., DiPietro M., Lovett M.C., Norman M.K., How Learning Works: Seven Research-Based Principles for Smart Teaching, (2010); Bereiter C., Scardamalia M., The Psychology of Written Composition, (1987); Bransford J.D., Brown A.L., Cocking R.R., How People Learn: Brain, Mind, Experience, and School: Expanded Edition, (2000); Brown P.C., Roediger H.L., McDaniel M.A., Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning, (2014); Brown S., Assessment for learning, Learn Teach Higher Education, 1, pp. 81-89, (2005); Fazio L.K., Huelser B.J., Johnson A., Marsh E.J., Receiving right/wrong feedback: Consequences for learning, Memory, 18, 3, pp. 335-350, (2010); Lang J., Small Teaching: Everyday Lessons from the Science of Learning, (2016); Miller M.D., Minds Online, (2014); Owen L., The impact of feedback as formative assessment on learner performance, International Journal of Teaching & Learning in Higher Education, 28, 2, pp. 168-175, (2016); Pashler H., Cepeda N.J., Wixted J.T., Rohrer D., When does feedback facilitate learning of words?, Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 31, pp. 3-8, (2005); Roschelle J., Feng M., Murphy R.F., Mason C.A., Online mathematics homework increases student achievement, AERA Open, 2, 4, pp. 1-12, (2016); Srivastava S.K., Tait C., An activity based learning approach for key Geographical Information Systems (GIS) concepts, Journal of Geography in Higher Education, 36, 4, pp. 527-545, (2012); Thompson M.M., Braude E., Evaluation of Knowla: An online assessment and learning tool, Journal of Educational Computing Research, 54, 4, pp. 483-512, (2016); Valencia-Vallejo N., Lopez-Vargas O., Sanabria-Rodriguez L., Effect of motivational scaffolding on e-Learning environments: Self-efficacy, learning achievement, and cognitive style, Journal of Educators Online, 15, (2018)",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,"6th ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2019",24 June 2019 through 25 June 2019,Chicago,150183.0,,978-145036804-9,,,English,"Proc.

An Automated Feedback System to Support Student Learning in Writing-to-Learn Activities,2019,WIP,,"Formative feedback has long been recognized as a crucial scaffold for student learning. Due to the job demand of instructors, it is impossible for them to provide individual students with on-demand formative feedback based on individual students’ performance. There is a growing interest in developing better approaches to provide students with automated formative feedback to assist their learning. In this research, we design and develop an automated formative feedback system to support student learning of conceptual knowledge in the course of writing assignments. In the proposed system, formative feedback can be generated automatically with the help of concept maps constructed from instructors’ lecture slides and students’ writing assignments. In this paper, we present the automatic approach to generate formative feedback, discuss the system architecture, and illustrate a prototype of the proposed system. © 2019 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).",,,,,,100,An automated feedback system to support student learning in writing-to-learn activities,Xiong Y.; Wu Y.-F.B.,"Xiong, Ye (57188814886); Wu, Yi-Fang Brook (7406893707)",57188814886; 7406893707,An automated feedback system to support student learning in writing-to-learn activities,2019.0,"Proceedings of the 6th 2019 ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2019",,,,,,,0.0,10.1145/3330430.3333657,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083952373&doi=10.1145%2f3330430.3333657&partnerID=40&md5=52856ca413ec58bd556014881c5f89d6,"New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, United States","Xiong Y., New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, United States; Wu Y.-F.B., New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, United States",Assessment; Automatic Feedback; Writing-to-Learn,Automation; Curricula; Scaffolds; Students; Assessment; Automatic approaches; Automatic feedback; Conceptual knowledge; Formative feedbacks; System architectures; Writing assignments; Writing to learn; Learning systems,,,,,,,"Zinsser W.K., Writing to Learn, (1989); Foltz P.W., Rosenstein M., Analysis of a large-scale formative writing assessment system with automated feedback, Proceedings of the Second ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, pp. 339-342, (2015); Villalon J., Et al., Glosser: Enhanced feedback for student writing tasks, 2008 Eighth IEEE International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies 2008; Black P., Wiliam D., Assessment and classroom learning, Assessment in Education, 5, 1, pp. 7-74, (1998); Villalon J., Calvo R.A., Concept maps as cognitive visualizations of writing assignments, Educational Technology & Society, 14, 3, pp. 16-27, (2011); Atapattu T., Falkner K., Falkner N., Acquisition of triples of knowledge from lecture notes: A natural language processing approach, Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Educational Data Mining, pp. 193-196, (2014); Atapattu T., Falkner K., Falkner N., Automated extraction of semantic concepts from semi-structured data: Supporting computer-based education through the analysis of lecture notes, Database and Expert Systems Applications, (2012); Atapattu T., Falkner K., Falkner N., Evaluation of concept importance in concept maps mined from lecture notes: Computer vs human, Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Computer Supported Education, (2014); Villalon J., Calvo R.A., Montenegro R., Analysis of a gold standard for concept map mining – How humans summarize text using concept maps, Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Concept Mapping, (2010); Hao J.-X., Yan A., Chi-Wai R., A semantic analysis method for concept map-based knowledge modeling, Proceedings of the First International Conference on E-Business Intelligence (ICEBI2010), (2010); Manning C.D., Et al., The stanford corenlp natural language processing toolkit, Proceedings of 52nd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: System Demonstrations 2014; Floyd R.W., Algorithm 97: Shortest path, Communications of the ACM, 5, 6, (1962)",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,"6th ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2019",24 June 2019 through 25 June 2019,Chicago,150183.0,,978-145036804-9,,,English,"Proc.

automaTA: Human-Machine Interaction for Answering Context-Specific Questions,2019,WIP,,"When online learners have questions that are related to a specific task, they often use Q&A boards instead of web search because they are looking for context-specific answers. While lecturers, teaching assistants, and other learners can provide context-specific answers on the Q&A boards, there is often a high response latency which can impede their learning. We present automaTA, a prototype that suggests context-specific answers to online learners’ questions by capturing the context of the questions. Our solution is to automate the response generation with a human-machine mixed approach, where humans generate high-quality answers, and the human-generated responses are used to train an automated algorithm to provide context-specific answers. automaTA adopts this approach as a prototype in which it generates automated answers for function-related questions in an online programming course. We conduct two user studies with undergraduate and graduate students with little or no experience with Python and found the potential that automaTA can automatically provide answers to context-specific questions without a human instructor, at scale. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

What do students at distance universities think about AI?,2019,WIP,,"Algorithms, drawn from Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, are increasingly being used in distance education. However, currently little is known about the attitudes of distance education students to the benefits and risks associated with AI. For example, is AI broadly welcomed by distance education students, thought to be irrelevant, or disliked? Here, we present the initial findings of a survey of students from the UK’s largest distance university as a first step towards addressing the question “What do students at distance universities think about AI?” Responses from the 222 contributors suggest that these students do expect AI to be beneficial for their future learning, with more respondents selecting potential benefits than selecting risks.

Peer Advising at Scale: Content and Context of a LearnerOwned Course Evaluation System,2019,WIP,,"Peer advising in education, which involves students providing fellow students with course advice, can be important in online student communities and can provide insights into potential course improvements. We examine reviews from a course review web site for online graduate programs. We develop a coding scheme to analyze the free text portion of the reviews and integrate those findings with students’ quantitative ratings of each course’s overall score, difficulty, and workload.

Towards Improving Students’ Forum Posts Categorization in MOOCs and Impact on Performance Prediction,2019,WIP,,"Going beyond mere forum posts categorization is key to understand why some students struggle and eventually fail in MOOCs. We propose here an extension of a coding scheme and present the design of the associated automatic annotation tools to tag students’ questions in their forum posts. Working of four sessions of the same MOOC, we cluster students’ questions and show how the obtained clusters are consistent across all sessions and can be sometimes correlated with students’ success in the MOOC. Moreover, it helps us better understand the nature of questions asked by successful vs. unsuccessful students. © 2019 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).",,,,,,100,Towards improving students’ forum posts categorization in MOOCs and impact on performance prediction,Harrak F.; Bouchet F.; Luengo V.; Bachelet R.,"Harrak, Fatima (57217075883); Bouchet, François (35172622400); Luengo, Vanda (22433258600); Bachelet, Rémi (6507049230)",57217075883; 35172622400; 22433258600; 6507049230,Towards improving students’ forum posts categorization in MOOCs and impact on performance prediction,2019.0,"Proceedings of the 6th 2019 ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2019",,,,,,,1.0,10.1145/3330430.3333661,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083952965&doi=10.1145%2f3330430.3333661&partnerID=40&md5=225064489339c7ebc0088577ac9107a6,"Sorbonne Université CNRS, Laboratoire d’Informatique de Paris 6, Paris, F-75005, France; Centrale Lille, University of Lille, France","Harrak F., Sorbonne Université CNRS, Laboratoire d’Informatique de Paris 6, Paris, F-75005, France; Bouchet F., Sorbonne Université CNRS, Laboratoire d’Informatique de Paris 6, Paris, F-75005, France; Luengo V., Sorbonne Université CNRS, Laboratoire d’Informatique de Paris 6, Paris, F-75005, France; Bachelet R., Centrale Lille, University of Lille, France",Clustering; Coding scheme; Discussion forum; MOOC; Student’s performance; Student’s question,Automatic annotation; Clustering; Coding scheme; Discussion forum; MOOC; Performance prediction; Students,,,,,,,"Almatrafi O., Johri A., Rangwala H., Needle in a haystack: Identifying learner posts that require urgent response in MOOC discussion forums, Computers & Education, 118, pp. 1-9, (2018); Cui Y., Wise A.F., Identifying content-related threads in MOOC discussion forums, Proc.

Causal Inference in Higher Education: Building Better Curriculums,2019,WIP,,"Higher educational institutions constantly look for ways to meet students’ needs and support them through graduation. Recent work in the field of learning analytics have developed methods for grade prediction and course recommendations. Although these methods work well, they often fail to discover causal relationships between courses, which may not be evident through correlation-based methods. In this work, we aim at understanding the causal relationships between courses to aid universities in designing better academic pathways for students and to help them make better choices. Our methodology employs methods of causal inference to study these relationships using historical student performance data. We make use of a doubly-robust method of matching and regression in order to obtain the casual relationship between a pair of courses. The results were validated by the existing prerequisite structure and by cross-validation of the regression model. Further, our approach was also tested for robustness and sensitivity to certain hyper parameters. This methodology shows promising results and is a step forward towards building better academic pathways for students. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",,,,,,100,Causal inference in higher education: Building better curriculums,Kaur P.; Polyzou A.; Karypis G.,"Kaur, Prableen (57213470607); Polyzou, Agoritsa (57188871440); Karypis, George (15069396800)",57213470607; 57188871440; 15069396800,Causal inference in higher education: Building better curriculums,2019.0,"Proceedings of the 6th 2019 ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2019",,,,,,,3.0,10.1145/3330430.3333663,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083954134&doi=10.1145%2f3330430.3333663&partnerID=40&md5=237c97a1b4127991e8ce7b4c6bcb0fcd,"University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, United States","Kaur P., University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, United States; Polyzou A., University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, United States; Karypis G., University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, United States",Average Treatment Effect; Causal Inference; Learning Analytics; Matching,Correlation methods; Education computing; Regression analysis; Average treatment effects; Casual relationships; Causal inferences; Causal relationships; Educational institutions; Learning Analytics; Matching; Student performance; Students,,,,,"Digital Technology Center; Intel Corp; National Science Foundation, NSF, (1447788, 1704074, 1757916, 1834251); Army Research Office, ARO, (W911NF1810344); Minnesota Supercomputing Institute, University of Minnesota, MSI","This work was supported in part by NSF(1447788, 1704074, 1757916, 1834251), Army Research Office(W911NF1810344), Intel Corp, and the Digital Technology Center at the University of Minnesota.

Investigating Learning Design Categorization and Learning Behaviour in Computational MOOCS,2019,WIP,,"We investigate learner efficiency by categorizing a computational MOOC and analyzing user behavior data from a learning design point of view. Learning design is important both when designing courses as well as studying them. Learning behavior can be observed from the MOOC platform data. For this study we ask two learning designer experts to categorize a course on MITx: “6.00.1x Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python”. We use these categorizations to investigate relationships with learning behavior by analyzing the MOOC platform data. Our study verifies that learning design can be correlated to learning behavior, e.g. students exhibit a pattern of behavior associated to a component’s difficulty and category.

Jack Watson: Addressing Contract Cheating at Scale in Online Computer Science Education,2019,WIP,,"Cheating has always been a problem for academic institutions, but the internet has increased access to a form of academic dishonesty known as contract cheating, or “homework for hire.” When students purchase work online and submit it as their own, it cannot be detected by commonly-used plagiarism detection tools, and this troubling form of cheating seems to be increasing. We present an approach to addressing contract cheating: an AI agent that poses as a contractor to identify students attempting to purchase homework solutions. Our agent, Jack Watson, monitors auction sites, identifies posted homework assignments, and provides students with watermarked solutions that can be automatically identified upon submission of the assignment. Our work is ongoing, but we have proved the model, identifying nine cases of contract cheating through our techniques. We are continuing to improve Jack Watson and further automate the monitoring and identification of contract cheating on online marketplaces. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",,,,,,100,Jack Watson: Addressing contract cheating at scale in online computer science education,Graziano R.; Benton D.; Wahal S.; Xue Q.; Miller P.T.; Larsen N.; Vacanti D.; Miller P.; Mahajan K.C.; Srikanth D.; Starner T.,"Graziano, Rocko (57210726607); Benton, David (57210729739); Wahal, Sarthak (57210725232); Xue, Qiuyue (57193318714); Miller, P.

To address this concern, we have developed an intervention to meet students’ learning needs and keep them motivated to learn according to their capabilities. In this paper, we will discuss the intervention and report on the preliminary results drawing on the quantitative and qualitative data of the course survey to interpret learners’ experiences using this approach. © 2019 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).",,,,,,100,Developing an intervention to advance learning at scale,Haniya S.,"Haniya, Samaa (57203552323)",57203552323,Developing an intervention to advance learning at scale,2019.0,"Proceedings of the 6th 2019 ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2019",,,,,,,0.0,10.1145/3330430.3333667,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083953270&doi=10.1145%2f3330430.3333667&partnerID=40&md5=bdd8928b4336abe631dd7531eab9d41f,"University of Illinois, IL, United States","Haniya S., University of Illinois, IL, United States","E-Learning Ecologies, Participation; Learning at Scale; MOOCs",Curricula; Education field; Learning at Scale; Massive open online course; MOOCs; Qualitative data; Technology advancement; E-learning,,,,,,,"Chen Y., Investigating MOOCs through blog mining, The International Review of Research in Open and Distributed Learning, 15, 2, (2014); Daniel J., Making sense of MOOCs: Musings in a maze of myth, paradox and possibility, Journal of Interactive Media in Education, 2012, 3, (2012); Liyanagunawardena T.R., Adams A.A., Williams S.A., MOOCs: A systematic study of the published literature 2008-2012, The International Review of Research in Open and Distributed Learning, 14, 3, pp. 202-227, (2013); Yuan L., Powell S., Cetis J., MOOCs and Open Education: Implications for Higher Education, (2013); Zheng S., Rosson M.B., Shih P.C., Carroll J.M., Understanding student motivation, behaviors and perceptions in MOOCs, Proceedings of the 18th ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work & Social Computing, pp. 1882-1895, (2015); Kalantzis M., Cope B., Conceptualizing e-learning, E-Learning Ecologies, pp. 1-45, (2017); Kizilcec R.F., Halawa S., Attrition and achievement gaps in online learning, Proceedings of the Second (2015) ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale, pp. 57-66, (2015)","S.

Supporting Instruction of Formulaic Sequences Using Videos at Scale,2019,WIP,,"To help language learners achieve fluency, instructors often focus on teaching formulaic sequences (FS)—phrases such as idioms or phrasal verbs that are processed, stored, and retrieved holistically. Teaching FS effectively is challenging as it heavily involves instructors’ intuition, prior knowledge, and manual efforts to identify a set of FSs with high utility. In this paper, we present FSIST, a tool that supports instructors for video-based instruction of FS. The core idea of FSIST is to utilize videos at scale to build a list of FSs along with videos that include example usages. To evaluate how FSIST can effectively support instructors, we conducted a user study with three English instructors. Results show that the browsing interactions provided in FSIST support instructors to efficiently find parts of videos that show example usages of FSs. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Achievements for building a learning community,2019,WIP,,"Twice a year the National University of Singapore hosts computer programming events open to the nation’s secondary, junior college, polytechnic and technical education students. To qualify for the live events, participants complete online programming activities during a month-long qualification phase open to all non-university students over the age of 12. The activities include game-based learning and traditional coding problems. During the past year, more than 1700 students participated in the two qualification phases and more than 200 students participated in the live events. At these events, students pair-program to test their programming abilities and showcase their coded creations in a tournament format. In the accompanying poster, we describe our work to build a community of intrinsically motivated learners and develop the technical infrastructure to support them both at scale during the qualification phase and live events.

Investigating the Impact of Skill-Related Videos on Online Learning,2023,Full Paper,Assessment @ Scale,"Many online learning platforms and MOOCs incorporate some amount of video-based content into their platform, but there are few randomized controlled experiments that evaluate the effectiveness of the different methods of video integration. Given the large amount of publicly available educational videos, an investigation into this content's impact on students could help lead to more effective and accessible video integration within learning platforms. In this work, a new feature was added into an existing online learning platform that allowed students to request skill-related videos while completing their online middle-school mathematics assignments. A total of 18,535 students participated in two large-scale randomized controlled experiments related to providing students with publicly available educational videos. The first experiment investigated the effect of providing students with the opportunity to request these videos, and the second experiment investigated the effect of using a multi-armed bandit algorithm to recommend relevant videos. Additionally, this work investigated which features of the videos were significantly predictive of students' performance and which features could be used to personalize students' learning. Ultimately, students were mostly disinterested in the skill-related videos, preferring instead to use the platforms existing problem-specific support, and there was no statistically significant findings in either experiment. Additionally, while no video features were significantly predictive of students' performance, two video features had significant qualitative interactions with students' prior knowledge, which showed that different content creators were more effective for different groups of students.

LENS: Predictive Diagnostics for Flexible and Efficient Assessments,2023,Full Paper,Assessment @ Scale,"The utility of assessment systems lies in their capacity to transform observations of student behavior into meaningful inferences about learning, knowledge, and skills. Common practice is to use latent variable models and produce scores on scales. However the simplicity of these psychometric models may filter out potentially valuable information present in student behavior. In particular, scale scores are not optimized to support granular instructional decisions. Machine learning offers promising alternatives, but proposed deep learning architectures are not ideally suited for operational testing conditions involving sparse data and shifting category labels for test questions. We present criteria for a model architecture that can leverage the rich, sparse behavioral data made available by modern assessment systems. We argue that behavioral predictions with well-quantified uncertainties are a viable alternative to scale scores for many applications. To satisfy these goals, we propose the LENS model architecture that combines the flexibility of machine learning and the uncertainty quantification of latent variable models to produce high-quality predictive diagnostic claims. Inspired by variational autoencoders, LENS maps student behavior to a latent probability distribution. In addition, LENS performs explicit Bayesian integration of each behavioral observation, allowing the model to incorporate sparse data with informative prior beliefs about students. We then compare the predictive capability of LENS to both latent variable and machine learning approaches. LENS generates competitive or superior predictions of behavior, particularly on sparse data, while requiring fewer modeling assumptions than other options and allowing for easy incorporation of auxiliary behavioral data. We also show how to produce interpretable claims about student behavior at multiple levels of granularity, allowing the same model to serve multiple reporting needs. Finally, we discuss the flexibility afforded by the proposed model for constructing assessments customized to both educator needs and student skills. © 2023 ACM.",,,,,,100,LENS: Predictive Diagnostics for Flexible and Efficient Assessments,Christie S.T.; Johnson H.; Cook C.; Gianopulos G.; Rafferty A.N.,"Christie, S.

Crowdsourcing the Evaluation of Multiple-Choice Questions Using Item-Writing Flaws and Bloom’s Taxonomy,2023,Full Paper,Assessment @ Scale,"Multiple-choice questions, which are widely used in educational assessments, have the potential to negatively impact student learning and skew analytics when they contain item-writing flaws. Existing methods for evaluating multiple-choice questions in educational contexts tend to focus primarily on machine readability metrics, such as grammar, syntax, and formatting, without considering the intended use of the questions within course materials and their pedagogical implications. In this study, we present the results of crowdsourcing the evaluation of multiple-choice questions based on 15 common item-writing flaws. Through analysis of 80 crowdsourced evaluations on questions from the domains of calculus and chemistry, we found that crowdworkers were able to accurately evaluate the questions, matching 75% of the expert evaluations across multiple questions. They were able to correctly distinguish between two levels of Bloom's Taxonomy for the calculus questions, but were less accurate for chemistry questions. We discuss how to scale this question evaluation process and the implications it has across other domains. This work demonstrates how crowdworkers can be leveraged in the quality evaluation of educational questions, regardless of prior experience or domain knowledge. © 2023 ACM.",,,,,,99,Crowdsourcing the Evaluation of Multiple-Choice Questions Using Item-Writing Flaws and Bloom's Taxonomy,Moore S.; Fang E.; Nguyen H.A.; Stamper J.,"Moore, Steven (57145946000); Fang, Ellen (58535494500); Nguyen, Huy A.

All A-board: Sharing Educational Data Science Research With School Districts,2023,Full Paper,Fairness and Equity @ Scale,"Educational data scientists often conduct research with the hopes of translating findings into lasting change through policy, civil society, or other channels. However, the bridge from research to practice can be fraught with sociopolitical frictions that impede, or altogether block, such translations-especially when they are contentious or otherwise difficult to achieve. Focusing on one entrenched educational equity issue in US public schools-racial and ethnic segregation-we conduct randomized email outreach experiments and surveys to explore how local school districts respond to algorithmically-generated school catchment areas (""attendance boundaries"") designed to foster more diverse and integrated schools. Cold email outreach to approximately 4,320 elected school board members across over 800 school districts informing them of potential boundary changes reveals a large average open rate of nearly 40%, but a relatively small click-through rate of 2.5% to an interactive dashboard depicting such changes. Board members, however, appear responsive to different messaging techniques - -particularly those that dovetail issues of racial and ethnic diversity with other top-of-mind issues (like school capacity planning). On the other hand, media coverage of the research drives more dashboard engagement, especially in more segregated districts. A small but rich set of survey responses from school board and community members across several districts identify data and operational bottlenecks to implementing boundary changes to foster more diverse schools, but also share affirmative comments on the potential viability of such changes. Together, our findings may support educational data scientists in more effectively disseminating research that aims to bridge educational inequalities through systems-level change. © 2023 ACM.",,,,,,100,All A-board: Sharing Educational Data Science Research with School Districts,Gillani N.; Beeferman D.; Overney C.; Vega-Pourheydarian C.; Roy D.,"Gillani, Nabeel (55760193900); Beeferman, Doug (6602927071); Overney, Cassandra (57209225584); Vega-Pourheydarian, Christine (58154028100); Roy, Deb (7402439504)",55760193900; 6602927071; 57209225584; 58154028100; 7402439504,All A-board: Sharing Educational Data Science Research with School Districts,2023.0,L@S 2023 - Proceedings of the 10th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,35,47,12.0,0.0,10.1145/3573051.3593377,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85161920953&doi=10.1145%2f3573051.3593377&partnerID=40&md5=807c34c240b0dafb9151cf5aec2aa887,"Northeastern University, Boston, MA, United States; Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States; Wellesley College, Wellesley, MA, United States","Gillani N., Northeastern University, Boston, MA, United States; Beeferman D., Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States; Overney C., Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States; Vega-Pourheydarian C., Wellesley College, Wellesley, MA, United States; Roy D., Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States",education; inequality; randomized experiments; segregation,Catchments; Digital storage; Board members; Catchment area; Civil society; Clickthrough rates (CTR); Inequality; Public schools; Randomized experiments; School board; Science research; Segregation; Electronic mail,,,,,MIT Center for Constructive Communication,"Funding for this project was provided by the MIT Center for Constructive Communication.

Assessing the Fairness of Course Success Prediction Models in the Face of (Un)equal Demographic Group Distribution,2023,Full Paper,Fairness and Equity @ Scale,"In recent years, predictive models have been increasingly used by education practitioners and stakeholders to leverage actionable insights to support student success. Usually, model selection (i.e., the decision of which predictive model to use) is largely based on the predictive performance of the models. Nevertheless, it has become important to consider fairness as an integral part of the criteria for model selection. Might a model be unfair towards certain demographic groups? Might it systematically perform poorly for certain demographic groups? Indeed, prior studies affirm this. Which model out of the lot should we choose then? Additionally, prior studies suggest demographic group imbalance in the training dataset to be a source of such unfairness. If so, would the fairness of the predictive models improve if the demographic group distribution in the training dataset becomes balanced? This study seeks to answer these questions. Firstly, we analyze the fairness of 4 of the commonly used state-of-the-art models to predict course success for 3 IT courses in a large public Australian university. Specifically, we investigate if the models serve different demographic groups equally. Secondly, to address the identified unfairnes - -supposedly caused by the demographic group imbalance - -we train the models on 3 types ofbalanced data and investigate again if the unfairness was mitigated. We found that none of the predictive models wasconsistently fair in all 3 courses. This suggests that model selection decision should be carefully made by both the researchers and stakeholders as the per the requirement of the domain of application. Furthermore, we found that balancing demographic groups (and class labels) is not enough - -albeit can be an initial step - -to ensure fairness of predictive models in education. An implication of this is that sometimes, the source of unfairness may not be immediately apparent. Therefore, ""blindly""attributing the unfairness to demographic group imbalance may cause the unfairness to persist even when the data becomes balanced. We hope that our findings can guide practitioners and relevant stakeholders in making well-informed decisions. © 2023 ACM.",,,,,,100,Assessing the Fairness of Course Success Prediction Models in the Face of (Un)equal Demographic Group Distribution,Deho O.B.; Joksimovic S.; Liu L.; Li J.; Zhan C.; Liu J.,"Deho, Oscar Blessed (57204718084); Joksimovic, Srecko (55837206800); Liu, Lin (57194036395); Li, Jiuyong (57193306418); Zhan, Chen (57193674724); Liu, Jixue (8416110900)",57204718084; 55837206800; 57194036395; 57193306418; 57193674724; 8416110900,Assessing the Fairness of Course Success Prediction Models in the Face of (Un)equal Demographic Group Distribution,2023.0,L@S 2023 - Proceedings of the 10th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,48,58,10.0,0.0,10.1145/3573051.3593381,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85167873954&doi=10.1145%2f3573051.3593381&partnerID=40&md5=d7e44b76b36f0d36889abdb67d0fd3e0,"University of South Australia, Adelaide, SA, Australia","Deho O.B., University of South Australia, Adelaide, SA, Australia; Joksimovic S., University of South Australia, Adelaide, SA, Australia; Liu L., University of South Australia, Adelaide, SA, Australia; Li J., University of South Australia, Adelaide, SA, Australia; Zhan C., University of South Australia, Adelaide, SA, Australia; Liu J., University of South Australia, Adelaide, SA, Australia",course success prediction; fairness in learning analytics; protected group imbalance,Population statistics; Predictive analytics; Course success prediction; Demographic groups; Fairness in learning analytic; Model Selection; Prediction modelling; Predictive models; Predictive performance; Protected group imbalance; Student success; Training dataset; Education computing,,,,,"Australian Research Council, ARC, (DP200101210); University of South Australia, UniSA",The work has been supported by Australian Research Council (DP200101210) and Postgraduate Research Scholarship of University of South Australia.,"Anderson H., Boodhwani A., Baker R.S., Assessing the Fairness of Graduation Predictions, Proceedings of The 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining (EDM 2019), pp. 488-491, (2019); Aulck L., Nambi D., Velagapudi N., Blumenstock J., West J., Mining University Registrar Records to Predict First-Year Undergraduate Attrition, International Educational Data Mining Society, (2019); Baker R.S., Hawn A., Algorithmic bias in education, International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, pp. 1-41, (2021); Batista G.E., Prati R.C., Monard M.C., Balancing strategies and class overlapping, International symposium on intelligent data analysis.

M-Powering Teachers: Natural Language Processing Powered Feedback Improves 1:1 Instruction and Student Outcomes,2023,Full Paper,Feedback @ Scale,"Although learners are being connected 1:1 with instructors at an increasing scale, most of these instructors do not receive effective, consistent feedback to help them improve. We deployed M-Powering Teachers, an automated tool based on natural language processing to give instructors feedback on dialogic instructional practices - -including their uptake of student contributions, talk time and questioning practices - - in a 1:1 online learning context. We conducted a randomized controlled trial on Polygence, a research mentorship platform for high schoolers (n=414 mentors) to evaluate the effectiveness of the feedback tool. We find that the intervention improved mentors' uptake of student contributions by 10%, reduced their talk time by 5% and improved student's experience with the program as well as their relative optimism about their academic future. These results corroborate existing evidence that scalable and low-cost automated feedback can improve instruction and learning in online educational contexts. © 2023 ACM.",,,,,,100,M-Powering Teachers: Natural Language Processing Powered Feedback Improves 1:1 Instruction and Student Outcomes,Demszky D.; Liu J.,"Demszky, Dorottya (57210871455); Liu, Jing (57209185120)",57210871455; 57209185120,M-Powering Teachers: Natural Language Processing Powered Feedback Improves 1:1 Instruction and Student Outcomes,2023.0,L@S 2023 - Proceedings of the 10th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,59,69,10.0,1.0,10.1145/3573051.3593379,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85167865898&doi=10.1145%2f3573051.3593379&partnerID=40&md5=78a802add9012a0f54ff272995fe4812,"Stanford University, United States; University of Maryland, United States","Demszky D., Stanford University, United States; Liu J., University of Maryland, United States",automated teacher feedback; natural language processing; randomized controlled trial,Automation; E-learning; Natural language processing systems; Students; Automated teacher feedback; Automated tools; Instructional practices; Language processing; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Randomized controlled trial; Student outcomes; Teacher feedback; Teachers'; Feedback,,,,,Melvin and Joan Lane Stanford,"We thank Heather Hill, Dan Jurafsky, Greg Walton, Gábor Orosz, and members of the Stanford HAI-Education seminar group for helpful feedback.

How Common are Common Wrong Answers? Crowdsourcing Remediation at Scale,2023,Full Paper,Feedback @ Scale,"Solving mathematical problems is cognitively complex, involving strategy formulation, solution development, and the application of learned concepts. However, gaps in students' knowledge or weakly grasped concepts can lead to errors. Teachers play a crucial role in predicting and addressing these difficulties, which directly influence learning outcomes. However, preemptively identifying misconceptions leading to errors can be challenging. This study leverages historical data to assist teachers in recognizing common errors and addressing gaps in knowledge through feedback. We present a longitudinal analysis of incorrect answers from the 2015-2020 academic years on two curricula, Illustrative Math and EngageNY, for grades 6, 7, and 8. We find consistent errors across 5 years despite varying student and teacher populations. Based on these Common Wrong Answers (CWAs), we designed a crowdsourcing platform for teachers to provide Common Wrong Answer Feedback (CWAF). This paper reports on an in vivo randomized study testing the effectiveness of CWAFs in two scenarios: next-problem-correctness within-skill and next-problem-correctness within-assignment, regardless of the skill. We find that receiving CWAF leads to a significant increase in correctness for consecutive problems within-skill. However, the effect was not significant for all consecutive problems within-assignment, irrespective of the associated skill. This paper investigates the potential of scalable approaches in identifying Common Wrong Answers (CWAs) and how the use of crowdsourced CWAFs can enhance student learning through remediation. © 2023 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,How Common are Common Wrong Answers?

High-Resolution Course Feedback: Timely Feedback Mechanism for Instructors,2023,Full Paper,Feedback @ Scale,"We study the problem of minimizing the delay between when an issue comes up in a course and when instructors get feedback about it. The widespread practice of obtaining midterm and end-of-term feedback from students is suboptimal in this regard, especially for large courses: it over-samples at a specific point in the course and can be biased by factors irrelevant to the teaching process. As a solution, we release High Resolution Course Feedback (HRCF), an open-source student feedback mechanism that builds on a surprisingly simple idea: survey each student on random weeks exactly twice per term. Despite the simplicity of its core idea, when deployed to 31 courses totaling a cumulative 6,835 students, HRCF was able to detect meaningful mood changes in courses and significantly improve timely feedback without asking for extra work from students compared to the common practice. An interview with the instructors revealed that HRCF provided constructive and useful feedback about their courses early enough to be acted upon, which would have otherwise been unobtainable through other survey methods. We also explore the possibility of using Large Language Models to flexibly and intuitively organize large volumes of student feedback at scale and discuss how HRCF can be further improved. © 2023 ACM.",,,,,,100,High-Resolution Course Feedback: Timely Feedback Mechanism for Instructors,Kim Y.;

From Answering for Points to Commenting for Others An Examination of the Posting Behaviors of High-reputation-score Users of Stack Overflow,2023,Full Paper,Informal Learning @ Scale,"In this paper, we examine posting behavior on a large-scale online knowledge sharing platform, Stack Overflow, and investigate how that behavior changes as users gain experience and status. We use a trace ethnographic approach, analyzing both the sayings and doings of users and the numerical and categorical trace data produced by their activities on the platform. Through analysis of this data, as well as interviews with users at different levels of experience, we identify a pattern of behavior where users shift their focus over time from directly answering questions themselves to supporting others and maintaining the quality of knowledge on the platform thus playing a particular role as the knowledge community scales © 2023 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,From Answering for Points to Commenting for Others: An Examination of the Posting Behaviors of High-reputation-score Users of Stack Overflow,Hillman T.; Seredko A.; Osborne T.K.; Nivala M.,"Hillman, Thomas (49963451900); Seredko, Alena (57218096461); Osborne, Tanya Karin (57205264859); Nivala, Markus (26633108900)",49963451900; 57218096461; 57205264859; 26633108900,From Answering for Points to Commenting for Others: An Examination of the Posting Behaviors of High-reputation-score Users of Stack Overflow,2023.0,L@S 2023 - Proceedings of the 10th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,92,98,6.0,0.0,10.1145/3573051.3593385,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85167870043&doi=10.1145%2f3573051.3593385&partnerID=40&md5=9c665315c2b1e9150a5efa2fb85ff6c1,"University of Gothenburg, Sweden","Hillman T., University of Gothenburg, Sweden; Seredko A., University of Gothenburg, Sweden; Osborne T.K., University of Gothenburg, Sweden; Nivala M., University of Gothenburg, Sweden",knowledge sharing; posting behavior; stack overflow; trace ethnography,Behaviour changes; Ethnographic approaches; Knowledge-sharing; Knowledge-sharing platform; Large-scales; Online knowledge sharing; Posting behavior; Stack overflow; Trace data; Trace ethnography; Knowledge management,,,,,,,"Anderson C., The long tail: How endless choice is creating unlimited demand, Random House, (2007); Campbell J.A., Aragon C., Davis K., Evans S., Evans A., Randall D.P., Thousands of positive reviews: Distributed mentoring in online fan communities, Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work, CSCW, 27, pp. 691-704, (2016); Chen B., Haklev S., Rose C., Collaborative Learning at Scale, International Handbook of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning, (2021); Attribution-ShareAlike 4. 0 International, (2018); Evans S., Davis K., Evans A., Campbell J.A., Randall D.P., Yin K., Aragon C., More Than Peer Production: Fanfiction Communities as Sites of Distributed Mentoring, Proceedings of the 2017 ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing, pp. 259-272, (2017); Geiger R.S., Ribes D., Trace Ethnography: Following Coordination through Documentary Practices, pp. 1-10, (2011); Hudgins W., Lynch M., Schmal A., Sikka H., Swenson M., Joyner D.A., Informal Learning Communities: The Other Massive Open Online""C, Proceedings of the Seventh ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale, pp. 91-101, (2020); Merchant A., Shah D., Bhatia G.S., Ghosh A., Kumaraguru P., Signals Matter: Understanding Popularity and Impact of Users on Stack Overflow, The World Wide Web Conference on-WWW '19, pp. 3086-3092, (2019); Movshovitz-Attias D., Movshovitz-Attias Y., Steenkiste P., Faloutos C., Analysis of the Reputation System and User Contributions on a Question Answering Website: StackOverflow, 2012 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining, IEEE, Istanbul, Turkey, (2012); Roy P.K., Singh J.P., Baabdullah A.M., Kizgin H., Rana N.P., Identifying reputation collectors in community question answering (CQA) sites: Exploring the dark side of social media, International Journal of Information Management, 42, pp. 25-35, (2018); Sengupta S., Haythornthwaite C., Learning with Comments: An Analysis of Comments and Community on Stack Overflow, Proceedings of the 53rd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, pp. 2898-2907, (2020); Vrani A., Tomasevi A., Alori A., Dankulov M.M., Sustainability of Stack Exchange Q&A communities: The role of trust, EPJ Data Sci, 12, 1, (2023); Wise A.F., Schwarz B.B., Visions of CSCL: Eight provocations for the future of the field, International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning, 12, 4, pp. 423-467, (2017); Yang J., Tao K., Bozzon A., Houben G., Sparrows and Owls: Characterisation of Expert Behaviour in StackOverflow, User Modeling, Adaptation, and Personalization, pp. 266-277, (2014); What's reputation.

The Relevance of Ivan Illich’s Learning Webs 50 Years On,2023,Full Paper,Informal Learning @ Scale,"In 1971, social critic Ivan Illich published Deschooling Society, a controversial work that critiqued mainstream education systems and proposed a radical alternative. While his work remains controversial, re-examining his ideas might advance efforts to design for learning at scale. First, we examine three design principles that emerge from Illich's writing on learning webs: (1) a holistic perspective that incorporates multidisciplinary thinking (in Illich's case, blending philosophy, politics, sociology, economics, theology, and cybernetics), (2) learning webs as a framework for thinking about learning beyond the limitations of school, and (3) broadening our view of what should be scaled (e.g., scaling opportunities rather than content). Second, we discuss three tensions in Illich's work that relate to scaling learning: (1) decentralization vs. centralization, (2) place-based vs. online learning at scale, and (3) serving the advantaged vs. the disadvantaged. In discussing these ideas and tensions, we discuss contemporary technologies and models, which may be seen as similar to learning webs. Finally, we suggest that Illich's work offers an opportunity to further connect work that sits across two related research communities: Learning @ Scale and connected learning. © 2023 Owner/Author.",,,,,,98,The Relevance of Ivan Illich's Learning Webs 50 Years on,Doroudi S.; Ahmad Y.,"Doroudi, Shayan (57190766981); Ahmad, Yusuf (58535520100)",57190766981; 58535520100,The Relevance of Ivan Illich's Learning Webs 50 Years on,2023.0,L@S 2023 - Proceedings of the 10th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,99,109,10.0,0.0,10.1145/3573051.3593386,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85167874608&doi=10.1145%2f3573051.3593386&partnerID=40&md5=53263b6e8319fee27929e647a9cc0f94,"University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, United States; Teach for America, New York, NY, United States","Doroudi S., University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, United States; Ahmad Y., Teach for America, New York, NY, United States",connected learning; Ivan Illich; learning exchanges; peer learning,Learning systems; Centralisation; Connected learning; Decentralisation; Design Principles; Education systems; Holistic perspectives; Ivan illich; Learning exchange; Peer learning; Scalings; Blending,,,,,,,"L@S 2023, (2022); Ames M.G., The charisma machine: The life, death, and legacy of One Laptop per Child, (2019); Brake D.C., The case for decentralized connected learning (Part 2: The Learning Exchange), (2017); Cayley D., Ivan Illich: An Intellectual Journey, 2, (2021); Fernando C., Online learning webs: Designing support structures for online communities, (2014); Hansen J.D., Reich J., Democratizing education.Examining access and usage patterns in massive open online courses, Science, 350, 6265, pp. 1245-1248, (2015); Harel I., Papert S., Constructionism, (1991); Hartch T., The Prophet of Cuernavaca: Ivan Illich and the Crisis of the West, (2015); Holt J., Instead of education:Ways to help people do things better, (2004); Illich I., Education Without School: How It Can Be Done, The New York Review of Books, 15, 12, pp. 25-31, (1971); Ito M., Arum R., Conely D., Gutierrez K., Kirschner B., Livingstone S., Michalchik V., Peppler K., Penuel W., Pinkard N., Et al., The connected learning research network: Reflections on a decade of engaged scholarship, (2020); Ito M., Gutierrez K., Livingstone S., Penuel B., Rhodes J., Salen K., Schor J., Sefton-Green J., Watkins S.C., Connected learning: An agenda for research and design, (2013); Kizilcec R.F., Saltarelli A.J., Reich J., Cohen G.L., Closing global achievement gaps in MOOCs, Science, 355, 6322, pp. 251-252, (2017); Knatz P., The FLEX LEx Net, (2011); Knatz P., FLEX history, experiences, (2012); Hailly T.N.K., McNamee L., O'Keefe B., Lost by design: Designing from the margins toolkit, (2021); Lave J., Wenger E., Situated learning: Legitimate peripheral participation, (1991); Matias N., Designing for Remix: Andres Monroy-Hernandez at the Berkman Center, mit Center for Civic Media, (2012); Mehta J., Datnow A., Changing the grammar of schooling: An appraisal and a research agenda, American Journal of Education, 126, 4, pp. 491-498, (2020); Papert S., Mindstorms: Children, computers, and powerful ideas, (1980); Pinkard N., Freedom of movement: Defining, researching, and designing the components of a healthy learning ecosystem, Human Development, 62, 1-2, pp. 40-65, (2019); Postman N., My Ivan Illich problem, Perennial Library, (1973); Reich J., Two stances, three genres, and four intractable dilemmas for the future of learning at scale, Proceedings of the Seventh ACM Conference on Learning Scale, pp. 3-13, (2020); Resnick M., Berg R., Eisenberg M., Beyond black boxes: Bringing transparency and aesthetics back to scientific investigation, The Journal of the Learning Sciences, 9, 1, pp. 7-30, (2000); Russell D., Black Genius: Inspirational Portraits of African-American Leaders, (2009); Shaw A.C., Social construction and the inner city: Design environments for social development and urban renewal, (1995); Squires G.D., The Learning Exchange: An experiment in alternative education, (1974); Tyack D.B., Cuban L., Tinkering toward utopia: A century of public school reform, (1995); Von Foerster H., Interpersonal relational networks, 1014, (1971); Von Foerster H., Illich, Ivan, pp. 1971-1974, (2018); Watters A., The history of the future of education, (2015)",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",ACM,"10th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale, L@S 2023",20 July 2023 through 22 July 2023,Copenhagen,190884.0,,979-840070025-5,,,English,L@S - Proc.

Exploring Students’ Perceptions and Engagement in Hybrid Flexible Courses,2023,Full Paper,Instruction @ Scale,"The Hybrid Flexible (HyFlex) instruction format provides learners with the flexibility to choose from in-person, online synchronous, or asynchronous learning. However, students' learning experiences with HyFlex has not been studied at scale. The primary goal of this study was to investigate how students' perceptions about the availability of learning resources relates to their course engagement and performance in a HyFlex learning environment. In Spring 2022, we administered an end-of-semester survey to one graduate and five undergraduate courses, each of which utilized the HyFlex instructional model. Courses were selected from three different colleges at a large public university in the United States. We investigated students' perceptions about the effectiveness, importance, and ease of use of all three learning modalities that were offered (in-person, online synchronous, and asynchronous) and the learning support options (instructor access outside of class, learning help resources, and flexibility to choose learning modality without restriction). With a sample size of 537, we found that 30% of surveyed students found in-person and online synchronous learning important for their learning whereas 60% found asynchronous learning and the flexibility to choose their learning modality important for their learning. When asked about their actual use of different modalities, students reported using asynchronous learning the most, followed by online synchronous learning. In-person learning was reportedly the least utilized. We found that non-real-time learning modalities contributed positively to overall student engagement. Students preferred to use asynchronous resources and have the flexibility to choose among learning modalities. Yet, results indicate that students who incorporated some real-time learning not only had higher performance-related engagement (e.g., confidence in their ability to succeed in the course) than those who relied primarily on non-real-time learning, but they also earned higher grades for the course. This suggests that utilizing some in-person or online synchronous modalities in conjunction with the student-preferred asynchronous options leads to improved course outcomes for both student engagement and course performance. © 2023 ACM.",,,,,,99,Exploring Students' Perceptions and Engagement in Hybrid Flexible Courses,Battestilli L.; Bohórquez E.B.; Khan S.; Meral C.,"Battestilli, Lina (18041987800); Bohórquez, Elaine B.

Managing TAs at Scale: Investigating the Experiences of Teaching Assistants in Introductory Computer Science,2023,Full Paper,Instruction @ Scale,"Teaching assistants (TAs) are essential members of post-secondary instructional teams, who often have considerable student-facing time. The recently increasing demand for introductory computer-science (CS) courses has resulted in a corresponding increased demand for TAs. The existing TA literature has predominantly focused on investigating the role of training in the TA experience, particularly with respect to performance. This provides little insight into how TAs experience their management. Consequently, we investigate the role of management in the experiences of introductory-level CS TAs. We provide the structure for a formal, tiered management scheme employed in a high-enrolment introductory CS course. This scheme attempts to address the challenges associated with managing TAs at scale. As a case study, we compare the experience of TAs under this new management scheme with that of TAs under an informal, unstructured management style used in smaller introductory CS courses. Specifically, we used questionnaires to look at TAs' self-efficacy and understand their experiences. While we did not find a significant difference in TA self-efficacy between the two management styles, thematic analysis of the open-response data revealed a greater number of challenges reported by the TAs under the tiered management system. TAs characterized this tiered system as ""organized""and frequently reported feeling overworked. Across both groups, TAs identified improved communication and additional training as factors that could improve their experience. Our findings suggest self-efficacy was not a sufficient measure to quantify TA experience. We propose framing TA experience based on their motivation and general well-being. © 2023 ACM.",,,,,,100,Managing TAs at Scale: Investigating the Experiences of Teaching Assistants in Introductory Computer Science,McDonald E.; Arevalo G.; Ahmed S.; Akhmetov I.; Demmans Epp C.,"McDonald, Emma (57215596649); Arevalo, Gisele (57974919800); Ahmed, Sadaf (58136636400); Akhmetov, Ildar (58062244600); Demmans Epp, Carrie (40660928200)",57215596649; 57974919800; 58136636400; 58062244600; 40660928200,Managing TAs at Scale: Investigating the Experiences of Teaching Assistants in Introductory Computer Science,2023.0,L@S 2023 - Proceedings of the 10th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,120,131,11.0,0.0,10.1145/3573051.3593384,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85167870446&doi=10.1145%2f3573051.3593384&partnerID=40&md5=23c4d7ce9bcadb5959ddf34d6e6de4d6,"University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada","McDonald E., University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada; Arevalo G., University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada; Ahmed S., University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada; Akhmetov I., University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada; Demmans Epp C., University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada",CS education; self-efficacy; TA management,Education computing; Engineering education; Computer Science course; Computer Science Education; Computer science teaching; Introductory computer science; Management scheme; Management style; Performance; Self efficacy; Teaching assistant management; Teaching assistants; Information management,,,,,,,"Braun V., Clarke V., Using thematic analysis in psychology, Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3, 2, pp. 77-101, (2006); Camp T., Adrion W.R., Bizot B., Davidson S., Hall M., Hambrusch S., Walker E., Zweben S., Generation CS: The growth of computer science, ACM Inroads, 8, 2, pp. 44-50, (2017); Chamillard A.T., Merkle L.D., Management challenges in a large introductory computer science course, SIGCSE Bulletin (Association for Computing Machinery, Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education), pp. 252-256, (2002); DeChenne S.E., Enochs L.G., Needham M., Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Graduate Teaching Assistants Teaching Self-Efficacy, Journal of the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning, pp. 102-123, (2012); DeChenne S.E., Koziol N., Needham M., Enochs L., Modeling Sources of Teaching Self-Efficacy for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Graduate Teaching Assistants, CBE-Life Sciences Education, 14, 3, (2015); Deci E.L., Ryan R.M., Intrinsic Motivation and Self-Determination in Human Behavior, (1985); Deci E.L., Ryan R.M., Autonomy and Need Satisfaction in Close Relationships: Relationship Motivation Theory, pp. 53-73, (2017); Guler M.G., Keskin M.E., Doyen A., Akyer H., On teaching assistant-task assignment problem: A case study, Computers & Industrial Engineering, 79, pp. 18-26, (2015); Hakkola L., Chien M.T., Pelletreau K., Exploring Socialization and Teaching Self-Efficacy through a Community of Practice for International Teaching Assistants, Journal of the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning, 20, 3, (2020); Hardre P.L., Instructional Design as a Professional Development Tool-of-Choice for Graduate Teaching Assistants, Innovative Higher Education, 30, 3, pp. 163-175, (2005); Hardre P.L., Teaching Assistant Development Through a Fresh Lens: A Self-determination Framework, The Journal of Faculty Development, 27, 2, pp. 52-61, (2013); Hutchings P., Shulman L.S., The Scholarship of Teaching: New Elaborations, New Developments, Change, 31, 5, pp. 10-15, (1999); Jones V., Kim Y., Ryu W., Intersecting Roles of Authority and Marginalization: International Teaching Assistants and Research University Power Dynamics, Journal of International Students, 10, 2, pp. 483-500, (2020); Kay D.G., Large introductory computer science classes: Strategies for effective course management, ACM SIGCSE Bulletin, 30, 1, pp. 131-134, (1998); Lim R., Guddeti V.P., Choueiry B.Y., An Interactive System for Hiring and Managing Graduate Teaching Assistants, Proceedings of the 16th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI'04).

"How Learning Experience Designers Make Design Decisions: The Role of Data, the Reliance on Subject Matter Expertise, and the Opportunities for Data-Driven Support",2023,Full Paper,Instruction @ Scale,"Learning Experience Designers (LXDs) play an increasingly consequential role in the creation of courses and training materials that meet the needs of diverse learner populations and the growing class scope. Emerging design requests for scalable and effective courseware introduce new challenges in Learning Experience (LX) design practice while providing an opportunity for researchers to understand LX workflows and design new tools to improve them. This paper presents an interview study with 21 LXDs from 18 different organizations with the goal of understanding LXDs' collaborative relationships with subject matter experts (SMEs), data needs, and contextual challenges. We further perform a survey study to validate the challenges and probe into LXDs' attitudes toward a suite of data-driven solutions. We find that LXDs demonstrate a strong desire to collect data to inform their design - including target learners' prior knowledge and relevant design precedents. LXDs want support in better collaborating with SMEs, acquiring and processing diverse learner data, identifying relevant research studies to communicate their design decisions, understanding domain-specific material, and creating quality materials (especially questions).

How Teachers Influence Student Adoption and Effectiveness of a Recommendation System for Algebra,2023,Full Paper,Instruction @ Scale,"Advanced learning technologies (ALT) have become increasingly available to teachers for classroom use. Research has suggested that many factors can influence teacher adoption and fidelity of use of ALT in the classroom, including teacher beliefs, knowledge and experience, technological factors, and instructional factors. However, there has been scarce research linking teacher factors to student adoption of ALTs. This study examined the relationships between teacher characteristics and practices and student adoption and learning gains with a video recommendation system embedded within a virtual learning environment (VLE) for Algebra. Secondary data was obtained from an experimental study conducted over one academic semester in middle and high schools in a southeastern state of the United States. The sample included 52 teachers and 2936 students. The data included teacher responses to three surveys, and student demographic and achievement variables. A random forest was used to predict the rate that the students followed video recommendations in the VLE. The results show that the recommendation followed rate is related to the teachers' fidelity of use, frequency of student monitoring, and experience with the VLE. Most of the survey items specifically evaluating teachers' beliefs about the recommender were important predictors of students' following video recommendations. Teacher monitoring through a dashboard was the most important predictor. The analysis of treatment effect heterogeneity of the video recommendation system was performed using the generic machine learning inference (GenericML) method paired with random forests. Results show that teachers of students who benefitted most reported spending more time using the videos of the VLE and following student progress through the dashboard, but less time on the VLE than teachers of students who benefit the least. Teachers of students who benefitted the least had larger classrooms, struggled more with the challenges due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and spent less time with classroom planning. The results support the recommendation that teacher professional development for ALT should engage groups of educators in increasing their experience with the application so that they build comfort and confidence in its use in ways in which students are most likely to benefit. © 2023 ACM.",,,,,,100,How Teachers Influence Student Adoption and Effectiveness of a Recommendation System for Algebra,Leite W.L.; Hatch A.D.; Kuang H.; Cavanaugh C.; Xing W.,"Leite, Walter L.

Benefit of Gamification for Persistent Learners: Propensity to Replay Problems Moderates Algebra-Game Effectiveness,2023,Full Paper,Instruction @ Scale,"Computer-assisted learning platforms (CALPS) increasingly include gamified elements to improve student outcomes by enhancing their engagement with content. Although evidence exists that gamified programs increase engagement and learning outcomes, there is little causal research on what programmatic mechanisms drive the effect between engagement and learning. In the following paper, we explore this relationship through a method of causal moderation known as fully latent principal stratification. Using data from a large-scale randomized control trial assessing gamified and traditional CALP systems' effects on algebraic knowledge, we estimate the impact of using the gamified CALP on students who engage with one of its key gamification elements - -replaying a problem after a suboptimal attempt. The gamified CALP asks students to manipulate algebraic expressions from start to goal states and provides feedback based on the efficiency of these manipulations, allowing students to replay the problems when their efficiency can be improved. We find that the effect of gamification is greater for students with a higher propensity to replay problems. This finding suggests that gamification elements that provide students with opportunities to retry problems are driving the game's efficacy and provide evidence for a scalable mechanism of gamification that can improve students' learning. © 2023 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,Benefit of Gamification for Persistent Learners: Propensity to Replay Problems Moderates Algebra-Game Effectiveness,Vanacore K.; Sales A.; Liu A.; Ottmar E.,"Vanacore, Kirk (57222734972); Sales, Adam (57193199650); Liu, Allison (55893525700); Ottmar, Erin (55634752900)",57222734972; 57193199650; 55893525700; 55634752900,Benefit of Gamification for Persistent Learners: Propensity to Replay Problems Moderates Algebra-Game Effectiveness,2023.0,L@S 2023 - Proceedings of the 10th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,164,173,9.0,2.0,10.1145/3573051.3593395,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85167870524&doi=10.1145%2f3573051.3593395&partnerID=40&md5=6fa49b808ababe956547e07e01f2ed09,"Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA, United States","Vanacore K., Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA, United States; Sales A., Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA, United States; Liu A., Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA, United States; Ottmar E., Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA, United States",causal inference; computer-assisted learning platforms; gamification; productive persistence,Algebra; Computer aided instruction; Computer games; Digital storage; E-learning; Efficiency; Learning systems; Causal inferences; Computer assisted learning; Computer-assisted learning platform; Gamification; Large-scales; Learning outcome; Learning platform; Productive persistence; Programmatics; Student outcomes; Students,,,,,"U.S. Department of Education, ED, (R305A180401, R305D210036); Institute of Education Sciences, IES; Worcester Polytechnic Institute, WPI","The research reported here was supported by the Institute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education, through an Efficacy and Replication Grant (R305A180401) and a Methodology Grant (R305D210036) to Worcester Polytechnic Institute.

How to Open Science: Analyzing the Open Science Statement Compliance of the Learning @ Scale Conference,2023,Full Paper,Open Science @ Scale,"There have been numerous efforts documenting the effects of open science in existing papers; however, these efforts typically only consider the author's analyses and supplemental materials from the papers. While understanding the current rate of open science adoption is important, it is also vital that we explore the factors that may encourage such adoption. One such factor may be publishing organizations setting open science requirements for submitted articles: encouraging researchers to adopt more rigorous reporting and research practices. For example, within the education technology discipline, theACM Conference on Learning @ Scale (L@S) has been promoting open science practices since 2018 through a Call For Papers statement. The purpose of this study was to replicate previous papers within the proceedings of L@S and compare the degree of open science adoption and robust reproducibility practices to other conferences in education technology without a statement on open science. Specifically, we examined 93 papers and documented the open science practices used. We then attempted to reproduce the results with invitation from authors to bolster the chance of success. Finally, we compared the overall adoption rates to those from other conferences in education technology. Although the overall responses to the survey were low, our cursory review suggests that researchers at L@S might be more familiar with open science practices compared to the researchers who published in theInternational Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) and theInternational Conference on Educational Data Mining (EDM): 13 of 28 AIED and EDM responses were unfamiliar with preregistrations and 7 unfamiliar with preprints, while only 2 of 7 L@S responses were unfamiliar with preregistrations and 0 with preprints. The overall adoption of open science practices at L@S was much lower with only 1% of papers providing open data, 5% providing open materials, and no papers had a preregistration.

Exploring Cross-Country Prediction Model Generalizability in MOOCs,2023,Full Paper,Prediction @ Scale,"Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have increased the accessibility of quality educational content to a broader audience across a global network. They provide access for students to material that would be difficult to obtain locally, and an abundance of data for educational researchers. Despite the international reach of MOOCs, however, the majority of MOOC research does not account for demographic differences relating to the learners' country of origin or cultural background, which have been shown to have implications on the robustness of predictive models and interventions. This paper presents an exploration into the role of nation-level metrics of culture, happiness, wealth, and size on the generalizability of completion prediction models across countries. The findings indicate that various dimensions of culture are predictive of cross-country model generalizability. Specifically, learners from indulgent, collectivist, uncertainty-accepting, or short-term oriented, countries produce more generalizable predictive models of learner completion. © 2023 ACM.",,,,,,100,Exploring Cross-Country Prediction Model Generalizability in MOOCs,Andres-Bray J.-M.; Hutt S.; Baker R.S.,"Andres-Bray, Juan-Miguel (57209512477); Hutt, Stephen (57195276908); Baker, Ryan S.

Evaluating a Learned Admission-Prediction Model as a Replacement for Standardized Tests in College Admissions,2023,Full Paper,Prediction @ Scale,"A growing number of college applications has presented an annual challenge for college admissions in the United States. Admission offices have historically relied on standardized test scores to organize large applicant pools into viable subsets for review. However, this approach may be subject to bias in test scores and selection bias in test-taking with recent trends toward test-optional admission. We explore a machine learning-based approach to replace the role of standardized tests in subset generation while taking into account a wide range of factors extracted from student applications to support a more holistic review. We evaluate the approach on data from an undergraduate admission office at a selective US institution (13,248 applications). We find that a prediction model trained on past admission data outperforms an SAT-based heuristic and matches the demographic composition of the last admitted class. We discuss the risks and opportunities for how such a learned model could be leveraged to support human decision-making in college admissions. © 2023 ACM.",,,,,,100,Evaluating a Learned Admission-Prediction Model as a Replacement for Standardized Tests in College Admissions,Lee H.; Kizilcec R.F.; Joachims T.,"Lee, Hansol (57219768327); Kizilcec, René F.

EliRank: A Code Editing History Based Ranking Model for Early Detection of Students in Need,2023,Full Paper,Prediction @ Scale,"Research on programming education shows that novice programming students benefit significantly from one-to-one tutoring. While many systems propose to replicate the effectiveness of one-to-one tutoring in large-scale classes, it remains a challenge to develop systems with an approach to finding students who need the tutors' help the most. In this paper, we explore the idea of predicting the priority of students in need with a data-driven approach. Among various metrics to calculate the priority of students in need, we adopt time-on-task metric. Previous studies have found that excessively long time-on-task can be used as an indication of students' struggling. Aligned with this, we reduce the problem of finding students with the highest priority to the problem of finding students with the longest time-on-task. To solve the reduced problem, we present EliRank, a ranking model that finds students with the longest estimated time-on-task, using the students' first few minutes of fine-grained code editing history. EliRank recommends students in the descending order of estimated time-on-task, enabling tutors to efficiently monitor and find the students in need at scale in real time. To evaluate the performance of EliRank, we build and publish a new real-world dataset consisting of 15 programming exercises solved by 4000+ students in an introduction to programming class at a university. Unlike the currently available open code editing history datasets, our dataset contains code editing operations at a character-level granularity to minimize the loss of contextual information from students. We also introduce diff-augmented abstract syntax tree (DAST), a novel structured code representation that minimizes the loss of fine-grained code change information during code parsing. The evaluation of EliRank on our dataset shows that EliRank effectively finds students with the longest estimated time-on-task, for early detection of students in need. Also, we illustrate in depth (i) the effectiveness of DAST, (ii) the potential to control the tradeoff between early detection and the prediction accuracy of the model, and (iii) the transferability to unseen programming exercise via zero-shot transfer learning. © 2023 ACM.",,,,,,100,EliRank: A Code Editing History Based Ranking Model for Early Detection of Students in Need,Park J.; Oh A.,"Park, Jungkook (57189375800); Oh, Alice (35190968400)",57189375800; 35190968400,EliRank: A Code Editing History Based Ranking Model for Early Detection of Students in Need,2023.0,L@S 2023 - Proceedings of the 10th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,204,214,10.0,0.0,10.1145/3573051.3593387,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85167871178&doi=10.1145%2f3573051.3593387&partnerID=40&md5=45e867bb36b347332cb8603a26a33357,"School of Computing, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea","Park J., School of Computing, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea; Oh A., School of Computing, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea",code editing history; machine learning; programming education; recommendation system,Codes (symbols); Education computing; Learning systems; Zero-shot learning; Abstract Syntax Trees; Code editing history; Fine grained; Large-scales; Machine-learning; Novice programming; Programming education; Programming exercise; Ranking model; Time on tasks; Students,,,,,,,"Ahadi A., Lister R., Haapala H., Vihavainen A., Exploring machine learning methods to automatically identify students in need of assistance, Proceedings of the eleventh annual international conference on international computing education research, pp. 121-130, (2015); Ahmed U.Z., Srivastava N., Sindhgatta R., Karkare A., Characterizing the pedagogical benefits of adaptive feedback for compilation errors by novice programmers, Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE 42nd International Conference on Software Engineering: Software Engineering Education and Training, pp. 139-150, (2020); Ambrose S.A., Bridges M.W., DiPietro M., Lovett M.C., Norman M.K., How learning works: Seven research-based principles for smart teaching, (2010); Baek J., Kang M., Hwang S.J., Accurate Learning of Graph Representations with Graph Multiset Pooling, International Conference on Learning Representations, (2020); Bai Y., Ding H., Bian S., Chen T., Sun Y., Wang W., Simgnn: A neural network approach to fast graph similarity computation, Proceedings of the Twelfth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining, pp. 384-392, (2019); Chen M., Wei Z., Huang Z., Ding B., Li Y., Simple and deep graph convolutional networks, International Conference on Machine Learning.

Convincing the Expert: Reducing Algorithm Aversion in Administrative Higher Education Decision-making,2023,Full Paper,Systems and tools @ Scale,"Algorithm aversion can be described as the tendency of human decision-makers to discount algorithmic recommendations more heavily than similar recommendations made by humans. It has been a phenomenon observed to be most acutely exhibited by domain experts. In our work, we focus on expert administrators in higher education making course credit equivalency decisions that affect the academic planning and potential degree progress of millions of prospective transfer students. Using human-centered design, we construct an AI-based platform for recommending matches to courses on a student's transcript to courses offered at another institution. We conduct a 2 x 2, between-subject experiment to investigate potential aversion mitigation techniques by manipulating the presence of outliers and allowing users to provide feedback to the algorithm. Our findings indicate that intentional, human-centered design and careful presentation of algorithm-based recommendations can help improve Human-AI interaction and productivity with implications for various domains of expertise. © 2023 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,Convincing the Expert: Reducing Algorithm Aversion in Administrative Higher Education Decision-making,Xu L.; Pardos Z.A.; Pai A.,"Xu, Lingrui (58535487800); Pardos, Zachary A.

GPTeach: Interactive TA Training with GPT-based Students,2023,Full Paper,Systems and tools @ Scale,"Interactive and realistic teacher training is hard to scale. This is a key issue for learning at scale, as inadequate preparation can negatively impact both students and teachers. What if we could make the teacher training experience more engaging and, as a downstream effect, reduce the potential for harm that teachers-in-training could inflict on students? We present GPTeach, an interactive chat-based teacher training tool that allows novice teachers to practice with simulated students. We performed two studies to evaluate GPTeach: one think-aloud study and one A/B test between our tool and a baseline. Participants took the role of a teaching assistant conducting office hours with two GPT-simulated students. We found that our tool provides the opportunity for teachers to get valuable teaching practice without the pressures of affecting real students, allowing them to iterate their responses both during and across sessions. Additionally, participants enjoyed flexibility in tailoring their responses according to the varied personas, needs, and learning goals. In this paper, we provide quantitative results and qualitative observations to inform future work in this area. We conclude with a discussion of actionable design ideas for such systems, as well as other ways to use this tool for evaluating teachers and students. GPTeach has recently been deployed into the teacher training component of an online course with over 800 novice teachers. © 2023 ACM.",,,,,,100,GPTeach: Interactive TA Training with GPT-based Students,Markel J.M.; Opferman S.G.; Landay J.A.; Piech C.,"Markel, Julia M.

Supporting Online Collaborative Work at Scale: A Mixed-Methods Study of a Learning Analytics Tool,2023,Full Paper,Systems and tools @ Scale,"Collaborative Learning Analytics (CLA) tools have recently emerged as a potential solution to address the onerous process of monitoring and providing timely feedback on collaboration skills in higher education students. However, prior studies on the efficacy of such tools have mainly been carried out in small, controlled settings. This study aims to measure the impact of a specific CLA tool that can be easily deployed on a larger scale with minimal instructor effort in real-world online group work activities. Additionally, this research examines the potential influence that the characteristics of the collaborative activity may have on the tool's effectiveness. The CLA tool under investigation displays speaking participation time and peer evaluation scores from students engaged in online collaborative activities as part of their regular courses. The tool was evaluated with five instructors and 156 students over the course of one semester. The effects of the tool on students' speaking participation and peer evaluation scores were quantitatively measured and tested. A qualitative analysis of reflections from both students and instructors provided supplementary information on the quantitative results. The main finding of this study indicates that the tool has an overall small positive impact. The effectiveness of the CLA tool is primarily modulated by the synchronous or asynchronous presence of the instructor, as students tend to interact more naturally and feel less scrutinized in the absence of instructor evaluation. Based on the discussion of the findings, this research suggests design insights to enhance future CLA tools at scale for the purpose of supporting the development of online collaboration skills. © 2023 ACM.",,,,,,100,Supporting Online Collaborative Work at Scale: A Mixed-Methods Study of a Learning Analytics Tool,Ochoa X.; Echeverria V.; Carrillo G.; Heredia V.; Chiluiza K.,"Ochoa, Xavier (15050959300); Echeverria, Vanessa (56016639400); Carrillo, Gladys (56982735900); Heredia, Vanessa (58535521100); Chiluiza, Katherine (55975399800)",15050959300; 56016639400; 56982735900; 58535521100; 55975399800,Supporting Online Collaborative Work at Scale: A Mixed-Methods Study of a Learning Analytics Tool,2023.0,L@S 2023 - Proceedings of the 10th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,237,247,10.0,0.0,10.1145/3573051.3596165,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85167867677&doi=10.1145%2f3573051.3596165&partnerID=40&md5=3e3805704d8bf52601ab2def22459afb,"New York University, New York, NY, United States; Escuela Superior Politecnica Del Litoral, Guayaquil, Ecuador; Monash University, Melbourne, Australia","Ochoa X., New York University, New York, NY, United States; Echeverria V., Escuela Superior Politecnica Del Litoral, Guayaquil, Ecuador, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia; Carrillo G., Escuela Superior Politecnica Del Litoral, Guayaquil, Ecuador; Heredia V., Escuela Superior Politecnica Del Litoral, Guayaquil, Ecuador; Chiluiza K., Escuela Superior Politecnica Del Litoral, Guayaquil, Ecuador",collaboration skills; online collaboration; participation time,Curricula; E-learning; Learning systems; Analytic tools; Collaboration skills; Collaborative activities; Collaborative learning; Collaborative Work; Mixed method; On-line collaborations; Participation time; Peer evaluations; Timely feedback; Students,,,,,,,"Bachour K., Kaplan F., Dillenbourg P., An interactive table for supporting participation balance in face-to-face collaborative learning, IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies, 3, 3, pp. 203-213, (2010); Baker M.J., Forms of cooperation in dyadic problem-solving, Rev. d'Intelligence Artif, 16, 4-5, pp. 587-620, (2002); Bartindale T., Chen P., Marshall H., Pozdniakov S., Richardson D., ZoomSense: A Scalable Infrastructure for Augmenting Zoom, Proceedings of the 29th ACM International Conference on Multimedia, pp. 3771-3774, (2021); Bodily R., Verbert K., Trends and Issues in Student-Facing Learning Analytics Reporting Systems Research, Proceedings of the Seventh International Learning Analytics amp; Knowledge Conference (Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada) (LAK '17), pp. 309-318, (2017); Shum S.B., Crick R.D., Learning dispositions and transferable competencies: Pedagogy, modelling and learning analytics, Proceedings of the 2nd international conference on learning analytics and knowledge, pp. 92-101, (2012); Charitopoulos A., Rangoussi M., Koulouriotis D., On the use of soft computing methods in educational data mining and learning analytics research: A review of years 2010-2018, International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 30, 3, pp. 371-430, (2020); Cornide-Reyes H., Riquelme F., Monsalves D., Noel R., Cechinel C., Villarroel R., Ponce F., Munoz R., A Multimodal Real-Time Feedback Platform Based on Spoken Interactions for Remote Active Learning Support, Sensors, 20, 21, (2020); Ganesh A., Palmer M., Kann K., What Would a Teacher Do, Predicting Future Talk Moves, (2021); Granda R.X., Echeverria V., Chiluiza K., Wong-Villacres M., Supporting the assessment of collaborative design activities in multi-tabletop classrooms, 2015 Asia-Pacific Conference on Computer Aided System Engineering.

A Novel Approach for Knowledge State Representation and Prediction,2020,Full Paper,Work-in-Progress/Demonstration Session,"Online learning systems with open navigation allow learners to select the next learning activity in order to achieve desired mastery. To help learners make an informed choice regarding the next learning activity, we propose to represent and communicate the learner's knowledge state as the average success rate in the course for each skill, rather than as the probability of correctly answering the next question. We first show that we can accurately estimate the proposed knowledge state. We then show that the proposed attention-based model to estimate the knowledge state requires fewer parameters, provides actionable information to the learners, and achieves equivalent or better accuracy compared to RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) based models. © 2020 ACM.",,,,,,100,A Novel Approach for Knowledge State Representation and Prediction,Bhatt S.; Zhao J.; Thille C.; Zimmaro D.; Gattani N.,"Bhatt, Shreyansh (55773429900); Zhao, Jinjin (57216820625); Thille, Candace (42062446600); Zimmaro, Dawn (16044237000); Gattani, Neelesh (57219709963)",55773429900; 57216820625; 42062446600; 16044237000; 57219709963,A Novel Approach for Knowledge State Representation and Prediction,2020.0,L@S 2020 - Proceedings of the 7th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,353,356,3.0,6.0,10.1145/3386527.3406745,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094876237&doi=10.1145%2f3386527.3406745&partnerID=40&md5=ad6e39dd1d6b729b232f2aa6bede3585,"Amazon.com, Seattle, United States; Amazon.com, Austin, United States","Bhatt S., Amazon.com, Seattle, United States; Zhao J., Amazon.com, Seattle, United States; Thille C., Amazon.com, Seattle, United States; Zimmaro D., Amazon.com, Austin, United States; Gattani N., Amazon.com, Seattle, United States",attention based knowledge tracing.; knowledge state; knowledge tracing,Knowledge representation; Online systems; Recurrent neural networks; Knowledge state; Learning Activity; On-line learning systems; Learning systems,,,,,,,"Corbett A.T., Anderson J.R., Knowledge tracing: Modeling the acquisition of procedural knowledge, User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction, 4, 4, pp. 253-278, (1994); Montero S., Arora A., Kelly S., Milne B., Mozer M., Does deep knowledge tracing model interactions among skills?, International Educational Data Mining Society, (2018); Patikorn T., Heffernan N.T., Baker R.S., Assistments longitudinal data mining competition 2017: A preface, Proceedings of the Workshop on Scientific Findings from the ASSISTments Longitudinal Data Competition, International Conference on Educational Data Mining, (2018); Piech C., Bassen J., Huang J., Ganguli S., Sahami M., Guibas L.J, Sohl-Dickstein J., Deep knowledge tracing, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems., pp. 505-513, (2015); Polson M.C., Richardson J.J., Foundations of Intelligent Tutoring Systems, (2013); Su Y., Liu Q., Liu Q., Huang Z., Yin Y., Chen E., Ding C., Wei S., Hu G., Exercise-enhanced sequential modeling for student performance prediction, Thirty-Second Aaai Conference on Artificial Intelligence, (2018); Vaswani A., Shazeer N., Parmar N., Uszkoreit J., Jones L., Gomez A.N., Kaiser L., Polosukhin I., Attention is all you need, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems., pp. 5998-6008, (2017); Wang Z., Feng X., Tang J., Huang G.Y., Liu Z., Deep knowledge tracing with side information, International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education, pp. 303-308, (2019); Xiong X., Zhao S., Van Inwegen E.G., Beck J.E., Going deeper with deep knowledge tracing, International Educational Data Mining Society, (2016); Yeung C.-K., Yeung D.-Y., Addressing two problems in deep knowledge tracing via prediction-consistent regularization, Proceedings of the Fifth Annual Acm Conference on Learning at Scale, 5, (2018)",,,Association for Computing Machinery,,"7th Annual ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2020",12 August 2020 through 14 August 2020,"Virtual, Online",162054.0,,978-145037951-9,,,English,LS - Proc.

A Quantitative Analysis of When Students Choose to Grade Questions on Computerized Exams with Multiple Attempts,2020,Full Paper,Work-in-Progress/Demonstration Session,"In this paper, we study a computerized exam system that allows students to attempt the same question multiple times. This system permits students either to receive feedback on their submitted answer immediately or to defer the feedback and grade questions in bulk. An analysis of student behavior in three courses across two semesters found similar student behaviors across courses and student groups. We found that only a small minority of students used the deferred feedback option. A clustering analysis that considered both when students chose to receive feedback and either to immediately retry incorrect problems or to attempt other unfinished problems identified four main student strategies. These strategies were correlated to statistically significant differences in exam scores, but it was not clear if some strategies improved outcomes or if stronger students tended to prefer certain strategies. © 2020 ACM.",,,,,,100,A Quantitative Analysis of When Students Choose to Grade Questions on Computerized Exams with Multiple Attempts,Verma A.; Bretl T.; West M.; Zilles C.,"Verma, Ashank (57219709618); Bretl, Timothy (6506270751); West, Matthew (36867775200); Zilles, Craig (6602243123)",57219709618; 6506270751; 36867775200; 6602243123,A Quantitative Analysis of When Students Choose to Grade Questions on Computerized Exams with Multiple Attempts,2020.0,L@S 2020 - Proceedings of the 7th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,329,332,3.0,1.0,10.1145/3386527.3406740,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094895597&doi=10.1145%2f3386527.3406740&partnerID=40&md5=c0d7ae0928eca49fa6cc2d73dbab394d,"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, United States","Verma A., University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, United States; Bretl T., University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, United States; West M., University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, United States; Zilles C., University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, United States",agency; assessment; computer-based testing; computerized exams; multiple attempts,Clustering analysis; Exam systems; Feedback options; Statistically significant difference; Student behavior; Student groups; Students,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF, (DUE-1915257); University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, UIUC","This work was partially supported by NSF DUE-1915257 and the College of Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign under the Strategic Instructional Initiatives Program (SIIP).

We describe how integrating FSM logic with existing assessment architecture enables us to extend from direct measurement to scaffolding and feedback interventions on a spectrum of timescales from 1-second to several hours. Four prototypes are shared, demonstrating how this FSM logic affords design across differing learning contexts.

Affordable Degrees at Scale: New Phenomenon or New Hype?  25-35,2020,Full Paper,Session 1,"Following the initial proliferation of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), a more recent trend has emerged toward offering ""Affordable Degrees at Scale""or ""Large, Internet-Mediated Asynchronous Degrees"". In this research, we set out to understand this space: the range in tuition costs for these programs, the variety of admissions standards, and the types of assessments used to evaluate these non-traditional students. In the process, however, we found that in many ways, these programs may not be as new as we initially perceived: similarly-priced online programs have existed from traditional universities for years. In this research, we explore these two questions: what are these new degrees at scale, and how do they actually differ from traditional programs? To explore this, we collected materials for 35 MOOC-based graduate degrees and numerous non-MOOC-based comparable degrees. We then explored the patterns in tuition, admissions requirements, and syllabus information. In this paper, we report the trends we identified in MOOC-based degrees, and attempt to answer the question: what makes these programs different from non-MOOC-based online programs of the past? Ultimately, we find that this new era of programs is similar in many observable ways. © 2020 ACM.",,,,,,94,Affordable Degrees at Scale: New Phenomenon or New Hype?,Park D.S.; Schmidt R.W.; Akiri C.; Kwak S.; Joyner D.A.,"Park, David S.

AlgoPlan: Supporting Planning in Algorithmic Problem-Solving with Subgoal Diagrams,2020,Full Paper,Work-in-Progress/Demonstration Session,"Planning a solution before writing code is essential in algorithmic problem-solving. However, novices often skip planning and jump straight into coding. Even if they set up a plan, some do not connect to their plan when writing code. Learners solving algorithmic problems often struggle with high-level components such as solution techniques and sub-problems, but existing representations that guide learners in planning, such as flowcharts, focus on presenting lower-level details. We use subgoal diagrams-diagrams made of subgoal labels and the relationships between them-as a representation that guides learners to focus on high-level plans when they develop solutions. We introduce AlgoPlan, an interface that enables learners to build their own subgoal diagram and use it to guide their problem-solving process. A preliminary study with seven students shows that subgoal diagrams help learners focus on high-level plans and connect these plans to their code. © 2020 ACM.",,,,,,100,AlgoPlan: Supporting Planning in Algorithmic Problem-Solving with Subgoal Diagrams,Choi K.; Chen S.; Shin H.; Son J.; Kim J.,"Choi, Kabdo (57219708243); Chen, Sally (57219713259); Shin, Hyungyu (57202043125); Son, Jinho (57219710867); Kim, Juho (39361826000)",57219708243; 57219713259; 57202043125; 57219710867; 39361826000,AlgoPlan: Supporting Planning in Algorithmic Problem-Solving with Subgoal Diagrams,2020.0,L@S 2020 - Proceedings of the 7th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,389,392,3.0,0.0,10.1145/3386527.3406750,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094875409&doi=10.1145%2f3386527.3406750&partnerID=40&md5=ce35d353ace6abb0a399b496e8752a95,"Kaist, Daejeon, South Korea; Brown University, Providence, United States; Algorithm Labs, Seoul, South Korea","Choi K., Kaist, Daejeon, South Korea; Chen S., Brown University, Providence, United States; Shin H., Kaist, Daejeon, South Korea; Son J., Algorithm Labs, Seoul, South Korea; Kim J., Kaist, Daejeon, South Korea",algorithmic problem-solving; planning; subgoal diagram,Algorithmic problem solving; Algorithmic problems; Guide learners; Problem solving process; Solution techniques; Sub-problems; Subgoals; Writing codes; Graphic methods,,,,,,,"Astrachan O.L., Non-competitive programming contest problems as the basis for just-in-time teaching, 34th Annual Frontiers in Education, 2004.

An Evidence-Based Learner Model for Supporting Activities in Robotics,2020,Full Paper,Work-in-Progress/Demonstration Session,"Teaching robotics is an attractive way of motivating students to learn computer science. However, it is also a challenging topic for students of all ages and only one teacher in a classroom is too little to support approximately 30 students at the same time. Therefore, intelligent tutoring systems might be a meaningful way to support students and teachers. In this paper we describe an approach to support computer science lessons in secondary schools by using a learner model. We are explaining how the three phases of our learner model (data collection-profile construction-profile application) can be implemented for teaching robotics by using different types of implicit and explicit data to generate feedback for the teacher concerning competencies and knowledge of the students on the one hand and by supporting collaboration and group formation amongst the students on the other hand. The model is derived from literature and supported by data from different studies. © 2020 ACM.",,,,,,100,An Evidence-Based Learner Model for Supporting Activities in Robotics,Schulz S.; Lingnau A.,"Schulz, Sandra (57146384100); Lingnau, Andreas (6602109876)",57146384100; 6602109876,An Evidence-Based Learner Model for Supporting Activities in Robotics,2020.0,L@S 2020 - Proceedings of the 7th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,397,400,3.0,2.0,10.1145/3386527.3406760,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094929594&doi=10.1145%2f3386527.3406760&partnerID=40&md5=d884001c21796afe824601aa4e5804a2,"Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Berlin, Germany; Ruhr West University of Applied Sciences, Bottrop, Germany","Schulz S., Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Berlin, Germany; Lingnau A., Ruhr West University of Applied Sciences, Bottrop, Germany",computer science education; feedback; learner model; robotics,Computer aided instruction; Learning systems; Robotics; Data collection; Evidence-based; Group formations; Intelligent tutoring system; Learner model; Secondary schools; Three phasis; Students,,,,,,,"Cocea M., Magoulas G.D., Group formation for collaboration in exploratory learning using group technology techniques, Knowledge-Based and Intelligent Information and Engineering Systems., 6277, pp. 103-113, (2010); Dillenbourg P., Overscripting cscl: The risks of blending collaborative learning with instructional design, Three Worlds of CSCL.

Analysis of Grading Times of Short Answer Questions,2020,Full Paper,Work-in-Progress/Demonstration Session,"We present an analysis of factors correlated to grading speed in short answer questions from college level STEM courses using a novel dataset collected by an online education company. By analyzing timestamp data, we were able to estimate how long instructors grade individual student responses, which we typically found to be less than 10 seconds. This dataset provides us with a unique opportunity to determine which steps in the grading workflow could benefit from intervention. We found that sorting responses by rubric similarity has the potential to drastically reduce grading time by up to 50% per response. We plan to follow this work by implementing an intelligent agent to present responses in a sorted order to minimize grading time. © 2020 ACM.",,,,,,100,Analysis of Grading Times of Short Answer Questions,Yen M.; Karayev S.; Wang E.,"Yen, Michael (57194036933); Karayev, Sergey (50561748500); Wang, Eric (57219713236)",57194036933; 50561748500; 57219713236,Analysis of Grading Times of Short Answer Questions,2020.0,L@S 2020 - Proceedings of the 7th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,365,368,3.0,3.0,10.1145/3386527.3406748,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094895342&doi=10.1145%2f3386527.3406748&partnerID=40&md5=5d051d72792d322427826bfb500eeb8f,"Turnitin, Oakland, United States; Turnitin, Seattle, United States","Yen M., Turnitin, Oakland, United States; Karayev S., Turnitin, Seattle, United States; Wang E., Turnitin, Oakland, United States",examinations; grading speed; grading time; learning at scale; short answer questions,Distance education; On-line education; Student response; Time-stamp; Grading,,,,,,,"Brooks M., Basu S., Jacobs C., Vanderwende L., Divide and correct: Using clusters to grade short answers at scale.

Analyzing K-12 Blended MOOC Learning Behaviors,2020,Full Paper,Work-in-Progress/Demonstration Session,"We investigate student learning behaviors in a Massive Open Online Course with in-person components. Our goal is to improve the design of the course through learning analytics. The programming language taught, App Inventor, is a drag-and-drop language to create Android applications. We visualize and quantify student behaviors such as automatic and manual saving of code, video sections viewed, and the various forms of knowledge required to understand the course material. It appears students are less likely to go from course material that teaches procedures to other material that teaches procedures than we would expect, and rarely review previous topics covered in the course. We also find students tend to save marginally less at the beginning and end of sessions.

Analyzing Pre-Existing Knowledge and Performance in a Programming MOOC,2020,Full Paper,Work-in-Progress/Demonstration Session,"Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are accessible to anyone with a device that can connect to the internet. MOOCs aim to increase the accessibility of higher-level knowledge and skills, such as programming. To understand how students are performing and struggling in the course, we investigate a popular MITx MOOC that teaches introductory programming. We look at problem set questions and examine students with different levels of pre-existing knowledge. Specifically, we study the number of attempts of each group per question and the mean final accuracy of each group per question. We find that for nearly all questions, students with no programming experience struggle more than students with prior programming experience. Moreover, we observe a potential turning point in the course where students of all experience levels begin to struggle. Our findings both show that two groups of MOOC students perform differently and inform question design in MOOCs by demonstrating which question types are particularly arduous. © 2020 ACM.",,,,,,100,Analyzing Pre-Existing Knowledge and Performance in a Programming MOOC,Burd H.; Bell A.; Hemberg E.; O'Reilly U.-M.,"Burd, Hannah (57219711481); Bell, Ana (57215551299); Hemberg, Erik (19638760600); O'Reilly, Una-May (6602579515)",57219711481; 57215551299; 19638760600; 6602579515,Analyzing Pre-Existing Knowledge and Performance in a Programming MOOC,2020.0,L@S 2020 - Proceedings of the 7th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,281,284,3.0,2.0,10.1145/3386527.3406728,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094875997&doi=10.1145%2f3386527.3406728&partnerID=40&md5=f0fd092b649610b0b7347af6982704aa,"Dartmouth College, Hanover, United States; Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, United States","Burd H., Dartmouth College, Hanover, United States; Bell A., Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, United States; Hemberg E., Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, United States; O'Reilly U.-M., Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, United States",edx; learning analytics; moocs; problem sets; question design; student background,Distance education; Introductory programming; Massive open online course; Programming experience; Question type; Turning points; Students,,,,,,,"Bajwa A., Bell A., Hemberg E., OReilly U.-M., Student code trajectories in an introductory programming mooc, L@S ', 19, (2019); Biswas S., Hemberg E., Law N., OReilly U.-M., Investigating learning design categorization and learning behaviour in computational moocs, Sixth Acm Conference on Learning @ Scale, (2019); DeBoer J., Stump G., Breslow L., Seaton D., Diversity in Mooc Students' Backgrounds and Behaviors in Relationship to Performance in 6.002x, (2013); Maiyuran J., Bajwa A., Bell A., Hemberg E., OReilly U.-M., How student background and topic impact the doer effect in computational thinking moocs, 2019 Ieee Learning with MOOCS., pp. 47-52, (2019); Reich J., Ruiperez-Valiente J.A., The Mooc Pivot., 363, 1, pp. 130-131, (2019)",,,Association for Computing Machinery,,"7th Annual ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2020",12 August 2020 through 14 August 2020,"Virtual, Online",162054.0,,978-145037951-9,,,English,LS - Proc.

Automatic RNN Cell Design for Knowledge Tracing using Reinforcement Learning,2020,Full Paper,Work-in-Progress/Demonstration Session,"Empirical results have shown that deep neural networks achieve superior performance in the application of Knowledge Tracing. However, the design of recurrent cells like long short term memory (LSTM) cells or gated recurrent units (GRU) is influenced largely by applications in natural language processing. They were proposed and evaluated in the context of sequence to sequence modeling, like machine translation. Even though the LSTM cell works well for knowledge tracing, it is unknown if its architecture is ideally suited for knowledge tracing. Despite the fact that there are several recurrent neural network based architectures proposed for knowledge tracing, the methodologies rely on empirical observations and trial and error, which may not be efficient or scalable. In this study, we investigate using reinforcement learning for the automatic design of recurrent neural network cells for knowledge tracing, showing improved performance compared to the LSTM cell. We also discuss a potential method for model regularization using neural architecture search. © 2020 ACM.",,,,,,100,Automatic RNN Cell Design for Knowledge Tracing using Reinforcement Learning,Ding X.; Larson E.C.,"Ding, Xinyi (57205168723); Larson, Eric C.

In this work, we present Bluejeans codE Leak deTection (BELT), a system that monitors online BlueJeans meetings for shared code and sends timely warning messages to meeting participants. To test BELT's robustness as an online proctor, we evaluate its code-text disambiguation, code detection from images of varying quality, and code detection from videos of varying resolution.

Challenges of Online Learning in Nigeria,2020,Full Paper,Work-in-Progress/Demonstration Session,"Education has traditionally been administered via physical interactions between teachers and students in classrooms. Through technological advancement in communications and digital devices, online education has been developed with the potential to scale education, making it affordable and accessible. With an internet connection and a laptop or mobile phone, learners can access massive open online courses (MOOCs) for free. Nonetheless, the opportunity to scale education and the advantages of online learning are not always fulfilled due to certain challenges. In this work, Socioeconomic, Sociocultural, and IT infrastructural factors are categorized as challenges hindering the adoption of online learning in Nigeria. Although some factors mitigating online learning have been identified in the past, there is relatively little empirical evidence indicating the reality and severity of these challenges. Since scaling education involves worldwide reach, local contexts such as found in Nigeria and other developing countries become critical. The objective of this work, therefore, is to understand these challenges, present empirical evidence through a questionnaire survey, rank these challenges in order of severity, and propose solutions. © 2020 ACM.",,,,,,100,Challenges of Online Learning in Nigeria,Abdulmajeed K.; Joyner D.A.; McManus C.,"Abdulmajeed, Kabir (57216800774); Joyner, David A.

Characterizing Teacher Connections in Online Social Media: A Case Study on Pinterest,2020,Full Paper,Work-in-Progress/Demonstration Session,"Increasingly many teachers are turning to online social media to supplement educational resources and meet students' needs in the classrooms. The diffusion of information from online social media to the classroom is significantly faster than traditional curriculum-based approaches. However, this is contingent upon how well teachers across an online social media network are connected. To understand this, we perform a thorough and large-scale investigation of teacher connections in online social media, which is lacking in the literature. To make this feasible, we construct a large dataset of teachers on Pinterest, an image-based popular online social media. Our dataset includes 540 teachers across 5 states and 48 districts, thousands of connections they have established (either with their peers or some other Pinterest users), and all the resources they have shared in their accounts. Then, taking into account some crucial teacher-related attributes (e.g., their districts, grade levels, etc), we characterize direct and indirect teacher connections. Moreover, we compare the physical (face to face) and virtual (Pinterest) network of our surveyed teachers using several graph-related metrics. The finding in this study can serve as a basis to investigate teachers on social media in a deeper manner. © 2020 ACM.",,,,,,100,Characterizing Teacher Connections in Online Social Media: A Case Study on Pinterest,Karimi H.; Torphy K.T.; Derr T.; Frank K.A.; Tang J.,"Karimi, Hamid (57204682086); Torphy, Kaitlin T.

Co-Teaching Computer Science Across Borders: Human-Centric Learning at Scale,2020,Full Paper,Session 3,"Programming is fast becoming a required skill set for students in every country. We present CS Bridge, a model for cross-border co-teaching of CS1, along with a corresponding open-source course-in-a-box curriculum made for easy localization. In the CS Bridge model, instructors and student-teachers from different countries come together to teach a short, stand-alone CS1 course to hundreds of local high school students. The corresponding open-source curriculum has been specifically designed to be easily adapted to a wide variety of local teaching practices, languages, and cultures. Over the past six years, the curriculum has been used to teach CS1 material to over 1,000 high school students in Colombia, the Czech Republic, Turkey, and Guinea. A large majority of our students continue on to study CS or CS-related fields in university. More importantly, many of our undergraduate student-teachers stay involved with teaching beyond the program. Joint teaching creates a positive, high-quality learning experience for students around the world and a powerful, high-impact professional development experience for the teaching team-instructors and student-teachers alike. © 2020 ACM.",,,,,,100,Co-Teaching Computer Science across Borders: Human-Centric Learning at Scale,Piech C.; Yan L.; Einstein L.; Saavedra A.; Bozkurt B.; Sestakova E.; Guth O.; McKeown N.,"Piech, Chris (55142243300); Yan, Lisa (57188732772); Einstein, Lisa (57219708157); Saavedra, Ana (57195221886); Bozkurt, Baris (23476648700); Sestakova, Eliska (57031866500); Guth, Ondrej (26658239100); McKeown, Nick (57192648565)",55142243300; 57188732772; 57219708157; 57195221886; 23476648700; 57031866500; 26658239100; 57192648565,Co-Teaching Computer Science across Borders: Human-Centric Learning at Scale,2020.0,L@S 2020 - Proceedings of the 7th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,103,113,10.0,4.0,10.1145/3386527.3405915,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094888350&doi=10.1145%2f3386527.3405915&partnerID=40&md5=70c91a7c84d5551193b500e1f3de20b0,"Stanford University, Stanford, United States; Izmir Demokrasi Universitesi, Izmir, Turkey; Czech Technical University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic","Piech C., Stanford University, Stanford, United States; Yan L., Stanford University, Stanford, United States; Einstein L., Stanford University, Stanford, United States; Saavedra A., Stanford University, Stanford, United States; Bozkurt B., Izmir Demokrasi Universitesi, Izmir, Turkey; Sestakova E., Czech Technical University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic; Guth O., Czech Technical University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic; McKeown N., Stanford University, Stanford, United States",co-teaching; course-in-a-box; cs for all; international education,Curricula; Open source software; Teaching; Czech Republic; High school students; Open-source curriculums; Professional development; Student teachers; Teaching practices; Teaching teams; Undergraduate students; Students,,,,,,,"Achimugu P., Oluwagbemi O., Oluwaranti A., An evaluation of the impact of ict diffusion in nigerias higher educational institutions, Journal of Information Technology Impact, 10, 1, pp. 25-34, (2010); Barron B.J., Martin C.K., Roberts E.S., Designing A Computer Science Curriculum for Bermudas Public Schools; Blomeke S., Buchholtz N., Suhl U., Kaiser G., Resolving the chicken-or-egg causality dilemma: The longitudinal interplay of teacher knowledge and teacher beliefs, Teaching and Teacher Education, 37, pp. 130-139, (2014); Brooks C.H., Community connections: Lessons learned developing and maintaining a computer science service-learning program, Sigcse Bull., 40, 1, (2008); Chen W., Wellman B., The global digital divide-within and between countries, It&Society, 1, 7, pp. 39-45, (2004); Connolly R.W., Is there service in computing service learning?, Proceedings of the 43rd Acm Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE 12), (2012); Dasgupta S., Hill B.M., Learning to code in localized programming languages, Proceedings of the Fourth (2017) Acm Conference on Learning @ Scale (L@S 17), (2017); Dasgupta S., Hill B.M., How ""wide walls"" can increase engagement: Evidence from a natural experiment in scratch, Proceedings of the 2018 Chi Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI 18); Dickson P.E., Using undergraduate teaching assistants in a small college environment, Proceedings of the 42nd Acm Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE 11), (2011); Gamboa L., Londono E., Assessing educational unfair inequalities at a regional level in colombia, Lecturas de EconomÃa, 12, pp. 97-133, (2015); Goldweber M., Barr J., Clear T., Davoli R., Mann S., Patitsas E., Portnoff S., A framework for enhancing the social good in computing education: A values approach, Acm Inroads, 4, 1, pp. 58-79, (2013); Graham R., The Global State of the Art in Engineering Education, (2018); Guo P.J., Non-native english speakers learning computer programming: Barriers, desires, and design opportunities, Proceedings of the 2018 Chi Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI 18), (2018); Hannon C., Huber M., Burnell L., Research to classroom: Experiences from a multi-institutional course in smart home technologies, Sigcse Bull., 37, 1, (2005); Jamieson L.H., Service learning in computer science and engineering, Sigcse Bull., 34, 1, (2002); Kalelioglu F., A new way of teaching programming skills to k-12 students: Code.

Code Free Chatbot Development: An Easy Way to Jumpstart Your Chatbot!  233-235,2020,Full Paper,Workshops,"Advancement in technology and innovation in teaching such as chatbot and extended reality can be daunting for teachers but as an educator, we need to leverage on these advancements to respond to the changes and challenges in the teaching and learning landscape. There are a number of tools available for teachers to use to overcome the challenges, and one of them is the application of artificial intelligence (AI) but creating a chatbot requires complex computer programming skills, and it is usually built from scratch to fit the intended educational purpose. This practice makes it difficult for teachers to adapt existing systems or to attempt in creating a similar version. In this workshop, we will be sharing our experiences gained from developing various chatbots for higher education using a commercial platform that can jumpstart your chatbot. © 2020 ACM.",,,,,,94,Code Free Chatbot Development: An Easy Way to Jumpstart Your Chatbot!,Luo C.J.; Wong V.Y.L.; Gonda D.E.,"Luo, Crystal Jing (57219711208); Wong, Victor Yiu Lun (57832282300); Gonda, Donn Emmanuel (56050906500)",57219711208; 57832282300; 56050906500,Code Free Chatbot Development: An Easy Way to Jumpstart Your Chatbot!,2020.0,L@S 2020 - Proceedings of the 7th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,233,235,2.0,2.0,10.1145/3386527.3405932,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094923242&doi=10.1145%2f3386527.3405932&partnerID=40&md5=a2798ba36ecae82498125ebc3a6584d2,"Technology-enriched Learning Initiative, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong; Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong; Center for Education Innovation, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, Hong Kong","Luo C.J., Technology-enriched Learning Initiative, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong; Wong V.Y.L., Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong; Gonda D.E., Center for Education Innovation, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, Hong Kong",Al in education; Chatbot; Educational technologies,Computer programming; Chatbot; Chatbots; Computer programming skills; Existing systems; Higher education; Teaching and learning; Artificial intelligence,,,,,,,"Gonda D.E., Luo J., Wong Y.-L., Lei C.-U., Evaluation of developing educational chatbots based on the seven principles for good teaching, 2018 Ieee International Conference on Teaching, Assessment, and Learning for Engineering (TALE), pp. 446-453, (2018); Hew K.F., Brush T., Integrating technology into k-12 teaching and learning: Current knowledge gaps and recommendations for future research, Educational Technology Research and Development, 55, 3, pp. 223-252, (2006); Luo C., Hew T.K.F., Lei C.-U., Oh E., Principle-guided flipped classroom implementation framework for teaching technological contents, 2017 Ieee 6th International Conference on Teaching, Assessment, and Learning for Engineering (TALE), pp. 449-456, (2017)",,,Association for Computing Machinery,,"7th Annual ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2020",12 August 2020 through 14 August 2020,"Virtual, Online",162054.0,,978-145037951-9,,,English,LS - Proc.

Cold Start Knowledge Tracing with Attentive Neural Turing Machine,2020,Full Paper,Work-in-Progress/Demonstration Session,"Deep learning based knowledge tracing approaches achieve high accuracy in mastery prediction with pattern extraction on a large learning behavior data set. However, when there is little training data available, these approaches either fail to extract the key patterns or result in over fitting. Ideally, we aim to provide a similar learning experience to both the first group of learners, who interact with a new course or a new activity with little learning behavior data to provide personalized guidance, and the learners who interact with the course later. We propose a novel architecture, Attentive Neural Turing Machine (ANTM), to solve the cold start knowledge tracing problem. The proposed ANTM comprises an attentive controller module and differential reading and writing processes with extra memory bank. Accuracy (ACC) and Area Under Curve (AUC) measures are used for model performance comparison. Results show the proposed approach can learn fast and generalize well to unseen data. It achieves around 95% ACC trained with only 3 learners, while conventional deep learning based approaches achieve only 65% ACC with over prediction issues. © 2020 ACM.",,,,,,100,Cold Start Knowledge Tracing with Attentive Neural Turing Machine,Zhao J.; Bhatt S.; Thille C.; Gattani N.; Zimmaro D.,"Zhao, Jinjin (57216820625); Bhatt, Shreyansh (55773429900); Thille, Candace (42062446600); Gattani, Neelesh (57219709963); Zimmaro, Dawn (16044237000)",57216820625; 55773429900; 42062446600; 57219709963; 16044237000,Cold Start Knowledge Tracing with Attentive Neural Turing Machine,2020.0,L@S 2020 - Proceedings of the 7th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,333,336,3.0,9.0,10.1145/3386527.3406741,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092376527&doi=10.1145%2f3386527.3406741&partnerID=40&md5=7bea117d9c1294a6a6f141746c2665ee,"Amazon.com, Seattle, United States; Amazon.com, Austin, United States","Zhao J., Amazon.com, Seattle, United States; Bhatt S., Amazon.com, Seattle, United States; Thille C., Amazon.com, Seattle, United States; Gattani N., Amazon.com, Seattle, United States; Zimmaro D., Amazon.com, Austin, United States",attention mechanism; knowledge tracing; neural turing machine,Curricula; Data mining; Machinery; Turing machines; Controller modules; Knowledge tracings; Learning experiences; Learning-based approach; Model performance comparisons; Novel architecture; Pattern extraction; Personalized guidance; Deep learning,,,,,,,"Abdelrahman G., Wang Q., Knowledge Tracing with Sequential Key-Value Memory Networks, (2019); Bhatt S., Zhao J., Thille C., Zimmaro D., Gattani N., A novel approach for knowledge state representation and prediction, Proceedings of the Seventh Annual Acm Conference on Learning at Scale, (2020); Cen H., Koedinger K., Junker B., Learning factors analysis-A general method for cognitive model evaluation and improvement, International Conference on Intelligent Tutoring Systems, pp. 164-175, (2006); Graves A., Wayne G., Danihelka I., Neural Turing Machines, (2014); Koch G., Zemel R., Salakhutdinov R., Siamese neural networks for one-shot image recognition, Icml Deep Learning Workshop, 2, (2015); Pavlik P.I., Cen H., Koedinger K.R., Performance factors analysis-A new alternative to knowledge tracing, Online Submission, (2009); Piech C., Bassen J., Huang J., Ganguli S., Sahami M., Guibas L.J., Sohl-Dickstein J., Deep knowledge tracing, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems., pp. 505-513, (2015); Ravi S., Larochelle H., Optimization As a Model for Few-Shot Learning, (2016); Santoro A., Bartunov S., Botvinick M., Wierstra D., Lillicrap T., Meta-learning with memory-Augmented neural networks, International Conference on Machine Learning., pp. 1842-1850, (2016); Vaswani A., Shazeer N., Parmar N., Uszkoreit J., Jones L., Gomez A.N, Kaiser L., Polosukhin I., Attention is all you need, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems., pp. 5998-6008, (2017); Vinyals O., Blundell C., Lillicrap T., Wierstra D., Matching networks for one shot learning, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems., pp. 3630-3638, (2016); Wang Z., Feng X., Tang J., Huang G.Y., Liu Z., Deep knowledge tracing with side information, International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education, pp. 303-308, (2019); Weston J., Chopra S., Bordes A., Memory Networks, (2014); Yeung C.-K., Yeung D.-Y., Addressing two problems in deep knowledge tracing via prediction-consistent regularization, Proceedings of the Fifth Annual Acm Conference on Learning at Scale, 5, (2018); Zhang J., Shi X., King I., Yeung D.-Y., Dynamic key-value memory networks for knowledge tracing, Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on World Wide Web.

Content Type Distribution and Readability of MOOCs,2020,Full Paper,Work-in-Progress/Demonstration Session,"Massive open online courses (MOOCs) provide a great opportunity to use multiple means of information representation through a mixture of various media such as text, graphics, and video, among others. However, most research on MOOCs focused on learning analytics and not much attention is given to content analysis. We gathered all text corpora and video transcripts of selected MOOCs using a web crawler and looked at word counts, clustered by distribution, and measured readability of the crawled data. Analyzing content distribution allows for a comparison of MOOCs regardless of topics, thus giving us an idea of what most course developers might think is ideal in terms of content distribution. This comparison along with readability analysis can be useful for course pre-run quality assessment and gauging content sufficiency. © 2020 ACM.",,,,,,100,Content Type Distribution and Readability of MOOCs,Carlon M.K.J.; Keerativoranan N.; Cross J.S.,"Carlon, May Kristine Jonson (57215307959); Keerativoranan, Nopphon (57204142980); Cross, Jeffrey S.

Designing Inclusive Learning Environments,2020,Full Paper,Workshops,"Large-scale online learning environments present new opportunities to address the need for greater inclusivity in education. Unlike residential environments, which have physical and logistic constraints (e.g., classroom configurations, sizes, and scheduling) that impede our ability to enact more inclusive pedagogy, online learning environments can be personalized and adapted to individual learner needs. As these environments are completely technology mediated, they offer an almost infinite design space for innovation. Social-scientific research on inclusivity in residential settings provides insight into how we might design for online learning environments, however evidence of efficacious digital implementations of these insights is limited.

"Developing Digital Clinical Simulations for Large-Scale Settings on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion: Design Considerations for Effective Implementation at Scale",2020,Full Paper,Work-in-Progress/Demonstration Session,"Digital clinical simulations (DCSs) are a promising tool for professional learning on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) issues across a variety of fields. Although digital clinical simulations can be integrated into large-scale learning environments, less is known about how to design these types of simulations so they can scale effectively. We describe the results of two studies of a digital clinical simulation tool called Jeremy's Journal. In Study 1, we implemented this simulation in an in-person workshop with a human facilitator. We found that participants described their learning experiences positively and reported changes in attitudes. In Study 2, we used the simulation within an online course but replaced the human facilitator with an asynchronous, text-based adaptation of the facilitation script. Although learners in Study 2 described the experience in the simulation positively, we did not observe changes in attitudes.

"Differential Assessment, Differential Benefit: Four-year Problem Roulette Analysis of STEM Practice Study",2020,Full Paper,Work-in-Progress/Demonstration Session,"Using five million responses to thousands of practice examination questions on an optional study service known as Problem Roulette, we explore subject-specific differences in assessment style, grade benefit from usage of the service, and differential features in study behavior and grade outcome by birth sex. Our study includes more than 20,000 students enrolled in eight terms of introductory courses in general chemistry, physics and statistics. Student responses in the space of accuracy and response time reveal domain differences; by these measures, physics problems are typically both more difficult and more complex. Grouping students by term-length practice volume, we find significant positive grade benefits to higher volumes of study in chemistry and statistics. Across all subjects, we find that females gain more grade benefit from high study volume than males. Female students also outwork males during prime study hours yet, on average, earn 0.13 ± 0.03 lower grade points in chemistry than males with the same response accuracy in practice, with null results in statistics and physics. © 2020 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,"Differential Assessment, Differential Benefit: Four-year Problem Roulette Analysis of STEM Practice Study",Weaverdyck N.; Anbajagane D.; Evrard A.E.,"Weaverdyck, Noah (57201188925); Anbajagane, Dhayaa (57202901743); Evrard, August E.

Effectiveness of Crowd-Sourcing On-Demand Assistance from Teachers in Online Learning Platforms,2020,Full Paper,Session 3,"It has been shown in multiple studies that expert-created on-demand assistance, such as hint messages, improves student learning in online learning environments. However, there are also evident that certain types of assistance may be detrimental to student learning. In addition, creating and maintaining on-demand assistance are hard and time-consuming. In 2017-2018 academic year, 132,738 distinct problems were assigned inside ASSISTments, but only 38,194 of those problems had on-demand assistance. In order to take on-demand assistance to scale, we needed a system that is able to gather new on-demand assistance and allows us to test and measure its effectiveness. Thus, we designed and deployed TeacherASSIST inside ASSISTments. TeacherASSIST allowed teachers to create on-demand assistance for any problems as they assigned those problems to their students. TeacherASSIST then redistributed on-demand assistance by one teacher to students outside of their classrooms. We found that teachers inside ASSISTments had created 40,292 new instances of assistance for 25,957 different problems in three years. There were 14 teachers who created more than 1,000 instances of on-demand assistance. We also conducted two large-scale randomized controlled experiments to investigate how on-demand assistance created by one teacher affected students outside of their classes. Students who received on-demand assistance for one problem resulted in significant statistical improvement on the next problem performance. The students' improvement in this experiment confirmed our hypothesis that crowd-sourced on-demand assistance was sufficient in quality to improve student learning, allowing us to take on-demand assistance to scale. © 2020 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,Effectiveness of Crowd-Sourcing On-Demand Assistance from Teachers in Online Learning Platforms,Patikorn T.; Heffernan N.T.,"Patikorn, Thanaporn (57189378994); Heffernan, Neil T.

These systems can be instrumented to provide learners with feedback to help them choose the next learning activity. One type of feedback is providing an estimate of the learner's current skill proficiency. A learner can then choose to skip the remaining learning activities for that skill after achieving proficiency in that skill. In this paper, we investigate whether predicting proficiency and communicating it to learners can save time for learners within a course. We evaluate the accuracy of the BKT based proficiency pre-diction framework for learner's proficiency prediction which considers one attempt per question. We extend the proficiency prediction framework to include multiple attempts at individual questions and show that it is more accurate in proficiency prediction than BKT based proficiency prediction framework. We discuss the potential implications of attempt enhanced framework on the learners' behavior for open navigation on-line learning systems. © 2020 ACM.",,,,,,100,Evaluating Bayesian Knowledge Tracing for Estimating Learner Proficiency and Guiding Learner Behavior,Bhatt S.; Zhao J.; Thille C.; Zimmaro D.; Gattani N.,"Bhatt, Shreyansh (55773429900); Zhao, Jinjin (57216820625); Thille, Candace (42062446600); Zimmaro, Dawn (16044237000); Gattani, Neelesh (57219709963)",55773429900; 57216820625; 42062446600; 16044237000; 57219709963,Evaluating Bayesian Knowledge Tracing for Estimating Learner Proficiency and Guiding Learner Behavior,2020.0,L@S 2020 - Proceedings of the 7th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,357,360,3.0,4.0,10.1145/3386527.3406746,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094915684&doi=10.1145%2f3386527.3406746&partnerID=40&md5=b76bfffc9852e09b890ca920accadeaa,"Amazon.com, Seattle, United States; Amazon.com, Austin, United States","Bhatt S., Amazon.com, Seattle, United States; Zhao J., Amazon.com, Seattle, United States; Thille C., Amazon.com, Seattle, United States; Zimmaro D., Amazon.com, Austin, United States; Gattani N., Amazon.com, Seattle, United States",baysian knowledge tracing; knowledge tracing; learner behavior analysis; mastery prediction,E-learning; Forecasting; Online systems; Bayesian knowledge tracings; Learning Activity; On-line learning systems; Learning systems,,,,,,,"Balter O., Zimmaro D., Thille C., Estimating the minimum number of opportunities needed for all students to achieve predicted mastery, Smart Learning Environments, 5, 1, (2018); Corbett A.T., Anderson J.R., Knowledge tracing: Modeling the acquisition of procedural knowledge, User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction, 4, 4, pp. 253-278, (1994); Khajah M., Lindsey R.V., Mozer M.C., How Deep Is Knowledge Tracing?, (2016); Pardos Z.A., Bergner Y., Seaton D.T., De Pritchard, Adapting bayesian knowledge tracing to a massive open online course in edx, Edm, 13, pp. 137-144, (2013); Pardos Z.A., Heffernan N.T., Kt-idem: Introducing item difficulty to the knowledge tracing model, International Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation, and Personalization, pp. 243-254, (2011); Piech C., Bassen J., Huang J., Ganguli S., Sahami M., Guibas L.J., Sohl-Dickstein J., Deep knowledge tracing, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems., pp. 505-513, (2015); Qiu Y., Qi Y., Lu H., Pardos Z.A., Heffernan N.T., Does time matter?

Examining Sources of Variation in Student Confusion in College Classes,2020,Full Paper,Work-in-Progress/Demonstration Session,"Students often experience confusion while learning, and if promptly resolved, it can promote engagement and deeper understanding. However, detecting student confusion and intervening in a timely and scalable manner challenges even seasoned instructors. To understand when and where students are most likely to be confused, we study the systematic occurrence of confusion in college classes among 29,511 students in twelve universities. We use a novel method for affect detection that allows students to self-report confusion on individual presentation slides during their classes. Across 1,366 class presentations, we find that confusion arises at different times during class and depends on class duration, class size, type of institution, and academic discipline. Confusion is most prevalent during short presentations, in small classes, low-tier institutions, and scientific disciplines. © 2020 ACM.",,,,,,100,Examining Sources of Variation in Student Confusion in College Classes,Chen Y.; Kizilcec R.F.,"Chen, Youjie (57203386946); Kizilcec, René F.

Explanation Mining,2020,Full Paper,Work-in-Progress/Demonstration Session,"Explanations are used to provide an understanding of a concept, procedure, or reasoning to others. Although explanations are present online ubiquitously within textbooks, discussion forums, and many more, there is no way to mine them automatically to assist learners in seeking an explanation. To address this problem, we propose the task of Explanation Mining. To mine explanations of educational concepts, we propose a baseline approach based on the Language Modeling approach of information retrieval. Preliminary results suggest that incorporating knowledge from a model trained on the ELI5 (Explain Like I'm Five) dataset in the form of a document prior helps increase the performance of a standard retrieval model. This is encouraging because our method requires minimal in-domain supervision, as a result, it can be deployed for multiple online courses. We also suggest some interesting future work in the computational analysis of explanations. © 2020 ACM.",,,,,,100,Explanation Mining,Bhavya; Zhai C.,"Bhavya (57210734881); Zhai, ChengXiang (35232046000)",57210734881; 35232046000,Explanation Mining,2020.0,L@S 2020 - Proceedings of the 7th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,321,324,3.0,1.0,10.1145/3386527.3406738,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094900160&doi=10.1145%2f3386527.3406738&partnerID=40&md5=5d0ad53155734944350bebcd82860af6,"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, United States","Bhavya, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, United States; Zhai C., University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, United States",explanations; language modeling for information retrieval; prior probability,Distance education; Natural language processing systems; Computational analysis; Discussion forum; Document priors; Language model; Online course; Retrieval models; Modeling languages,,,,,,,"De Bra P., Calvi L., Aha!

Guidance on How Learning at Scale Can be Made More Accessible,2020,Full Paper,Work-in-Progress/Demonstration Session,"While learning at scale has the potential to widen access to education, the accessibility of courses offered on Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) platforms has not been researched in depth. This paper begins to fill that gap. Data was gathered using the participatory 'Evidence Café' method. Thematic analysis identified characteristics of accessible courses on these platforms. These characteristics include elements of both technology and pedagogy. Capturing and analysing expert insights enables this paper to provide guidance on how online courses can be made more accessible. The findings suggest that course production teams need to work collaboratively with providers to address issues of accessibility and involve learners in design, testing and evaluation.

Human Languages in Source Code: Auto-Translation for Localized Instruction,2020,Full Paper,Session 5,"Computer science education has promised open access around the world, but access is largely determined by what human language you speak. As younger students learn computer science it is less appropriate to assume that they should learn English beforehand. To that end, we present CodeInternational, the first tool to translate code between human languages. To develop a theory of non-English code, and inform our translation decisions, we conduct a study of public code repositories on GitHub. The study is to the best of our knowledge the first on human-language in code and covers 2.9 million Java repositories. To demonstrate CodeInternational's educational utility, we build an interactive version of the popular English-language Karel reader and translate it into 100 spoken languages. Our translations have already been used in classrooms around the world, and represent a first step in an important open CS-education problem. © 2020 ACM.",,,,,,100,Human Languages in Source Code: Auto-Translation for Localized Instruction,Piech C.; Abu-El-Haija S.,"Piech, Chris (55142243300); Abu-El-Haija, Sami (55657241000)",55142243300; 55657241000,Human Languages in Source Code: Auto-Translation for Localized Instruction,2020.0,L@S 2020 - Proceedings of the 7th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,167,174,7.0,2.0,10.1145/3386527.3405916,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094927237&doi=10.1145%2f3386527.3405916&partnerID=40&md5=b78da4da32477928235e3dc9283eb8be,"Stanford University, Stanford, United States; University of Southern California, Los Angeles, United States","Piech C., Stanford University, Stanford, United States; Abu-El-Haija S., University of Southern California, Los Angeles, United States",github; human-language; source-code; translation,Education computing; Computer Science Education; CS education; English languages; Human language; Source codes; Spoken languages; Translation (languages),,,,,,,"Arbabi M., Fischthal S.M., Cheng V.C., Bart E., Algorithms for arabic name transliteration, Ibm Journal of Research and Development, 38, 2, pp. 183-194; Bahdanau D., Cho K., Bengio Y., Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate; Banerjee R., Liu L., Sobel K., Pitt C., Lee K.L., Wang M., Chen S., Davison L., Yip J.C., Ko A.L., Et al., Empowering families facing english literacy challenges to jointly engage in computer programming, Proceedings of the 2018 Chi Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, (2018); Becker B.W., Teaching csl with karel the robot in java, Acm Sigcse Bulletin, 33, pp. 50-54, (2001); Blincoe K., Sheoran L., Goggins S., Petakovic E., Damian D., Understanding the popular users: Following, affiliation influence and leadership on github, Information and Software Technology, 70, pp. 30-39, (2016); Brinkman B., Diekman A., Applying the communal goal congruity perspective to enhance diversity and inclusion in undergraduate computing degrees, Proceedings of the 47th Acm Technical Symposium on Computing Science Education, pp. 102-107, (2016); Byckling P., Gerdt P., Sajaniemi J., Roles of variables in object-oriented programming, Companion to the 20th Annual Acm Sigplan Conference on Object-oriented Programming, Systems, Languages, and Applications, pp. 350-355, (2005); Cervantes I., El Espanol: Una Lengua Viva.

Identifying Preparatory Courses that Predict Student Success in Quantitative Subjects,2020,Full Paper,Work-in-Progress/Demonstration Session,"College courses are often organized into hierarchical sequences, with foundational courses recommended or required as prerequisites for other offerings. While the wisdom of particular sequences is usually ascertained on the basis of faculty experience or student peer networks, machine learning techniques and ubiquitous transcript data make it possible to systematically identify the courses that best predict subsequent high achievement across entire curricula and student populations. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by analyzing five years of course sequences and earned grades for 13,218 undergraduates enrolled in courses with substantial quantitative content at a private research university. Findings indicate that prior completion of specific courses is positively associated with success in subsequent target courses, and suggest that academic planning could be enhanced through scaled observation of the revealed benefits of course sequences. © 2020 ACM.",,,,,,100,Identifying Preparatory Courses that Predict Student Success in Quantitative Subjects,Davis G.M.; Abuhashem A.A.; Lang D.; Stevens M.L.,"Davis, Glenn M.

Inferring Creativity in Visual Programming Environments,2020,Full Paper,Work-in-Progress/Demonstration Session,"This paper explores the use of data analytics for identifying creativity in visual programming. Visual programming environments are increasingly included in the schools curriculum. Their potential for promoting creative thinking in students is an important factor in their adoption. However, there does not exist a standard approach for detecting creativity in students' programming behavior, and analyzing programs manually requires human expertise and is time consuming. This work provides a computational tool for measuring creativity in visual programming that combines theory from the literature with data mining approaches. It adapts classical dimensions of creative processes to our setting, and considers new aspects such as visual elements of the visual programming projects. We apply our approach to the Scratch programming environment, measuring the creativity score of hundreds of projects. We show a preliminary comparison between our metrics and teacher ratings. © 2020 ACM.",,,,,,100,Inferring Creativity in Visual Programming Environments,Kovalkov A.; Segal A.; Gal K.,"Kovalkov, Anastasia (57219716482); Segal, Avi (56911827600); Gal, Kobi (55790350200)",57219716482; 56911827600; 55790350200,Inferring Creativity in Visual Programming Environments,2020.0,L@S 2020 - Proceedings of the 7th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,269,272,3.0,7.0,10.1145/3386527.3406725,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094880286&doi=10.1145%2f3386527.3406725&partnerID=40&md5=d2c4db5c1ac088da061f5a3cd810e30c,"Ben-Gurion University, Beer Sheva, Israel","Kovalkov A., Ben-Gurion University, Beer Sheva, Israel; Segal A., Ben-Gurion University, Beer Sheva, Israel; Gal K., Ben-Gurion University, Beer Sheva, Israel",creativity; creativity tests; visual programming environments,Computation theory; Computer programming; Consumer behavior; Curricula; Data Analytics; Computational tools; Creative process; Creative thinking; Human expertise; Programming environment; Visual elements; Visual programming; Visual programming environments; Data mining,,,,,,,"Abdi H., The kendall rank correlation coefficient, Encyclopedia of Measurement and Statistics, pp. 508-510, (2007); Cropley A.J., Defining and measuring creativity: Are creativity tests worth using?, Roeper Review, 23, 2, pp. 72-79, (2000); Deng J., Dong W., Socher R., Li L.-J., Li K., Li F.-F., Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database, 2009 Ieee Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 248-255, (2009); He K., Zhang X., Ren S., Sun J., Deep residual learning for image recognition, Proceedings of the Ieee Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 770-778, (2016); Hershkovitz A., Sitman R., Israel-Fishelson R., Eguiluz A., Garaizar P., Guenaga M., Creativity in the acquisition of computational thinking, Interactive Learning Environments, 27, 5-6, pp. 628-644, (2019); Ramos J., Using tf-idf to determine word relevance in document queries, Proceedings of the First Instructional Conference on Machine Learning, 242, pp. 133-142, (2003); Resnick M., Maloney J., Monroy-Hernandez A., Rusk N., Eastmond E., Brennan K., Millner A., Rosenbaum E., Silver J., Silverman B., Scratch: Programming for all, Commun.

Informal Learning Communities: The Other Massive Open Online 'C',2020,Full Paper,Session 3,"While the literature on learning at scale has largely focused on MOOCs, online degree programs, and AI techniques for supporting scalable learning experiences, informal learning communities have been relatively underrepresented. None-theless, these massive open online learning communities regularly draw far more engaged users than the typical MOOC. Their informal structure, however, makes them significantly more difficult to study. In this work, we take a first step toward attempting to understand these communi-ties specifically from the perspective of scale. Taking a sample of 62 such communities, we develop a tagging sys-tem for understanding the specific features and how they relate to scale. For example, just as a MOOC cannot man-ually grade every assignment, so also an informal learning community cannot approve every contribution; and just as MOOCs therefore employ autograding, informal learning communities employ crowd-sourced moderation or plat-form-driven enforcement. Using these tags, we then select several communities for deeper case studies. We also use these tags to make sense of learning-based subreddits from the popular community site Reddit, which offers an API for programmatic analysis. Based on these techniques, we offer findings about the performance of informal learning communities at scale and issue a call to include these envi-ronments more fully in future research on learning at scale. © 2020 ACM.",,,,,,100,Informal Learning Communities: The Other Massive Open Online 'C',Hudgins W.; Lynch M.; Schmal A.; Sikka H.; Swenson M.; Joyner D.A.,"Hudgins, Will (57219713068); Lynch, Michael (57219711217); Schmal, Ash (57219715877); Sikka, Harsh (57225377967); Swenson, Michael (57219715166); Joyner, David A.

Interpretable Models Do Not Compromise Accuracy or Fairness in Predicting College Success,2020,Full Paper,Work-in-Progress/Demonstration Session,"The presence of ""big data""in higher education has led to the increasing popularity of predictive analytics for guiding various stakeholders on appropriate actions to support student success. In developing such applications, model selection is a central issue. As such, this study presents a comprehensive examination of five commonly used machine learning models in student success prediction. Using administrative and learning management system (LMS) data for nearly 2,000 college students at a public university, we employ the models to predict short-term and long-term academic success. Beyond the tradeoff between model interpretability and accuracy, we also focus on the fairness of these models with regard to different student populations. Our findings suggest that more interpretable models such as logistic regression do not necessarily compromise predictive accuracy. Also, they lead to no more, if not less, prediction bias against disadvantaged student groups than complicated models. Moreover, prediction biases against certain groups persist even in the fairest model. These results thus recommend using simpler algorithms in conjunction with human evaluation in instructional and institutional applications of student success prediction when valid student features are in place. © 2020 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,Interpretable Models Do Not Compromise Accuracy or Fairness in Predicting College Success,Kung C.; Yu R.,"Kung, Catherine (57219712518); Yu, Renzhe (57203392525)",57219712518; 57203392525,Interpretable Models Do Not Compromise Accuracy or Fairness in Predicting College Success,2020.0,L@S 2020 - Proceedings of the 7th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,413,416,3.0,12.0,10.1145/3386527.3406755,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094901310&doi=10.1145%2f3386527.3406755&partnerID=40&md5=88f46c921515fe38dc75304678dacfee,"University of California, United States","Kung C., University of California, United States; Yu R., University of California, United States",fairness; higher education; machine learning; predictive analytics,Education computing; Forecasting; Information management; Learning systems; Logistic regression; Students; Comprehensive examination; Interpretability and accuracy; Learning management system; Machine learning models; Predictive accuracy; Public universities; SIMPLER algorithms; Student populations; Predictive analytics,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF, (1535300)",This study is supported by the National Science Foundation (Grant Number 1535300).,"Barocas S., Hardt M., Narayanan A., Fairness and Machine Learning, (2019); Ekowo M., Palmer I., The promise and peril of predictive analytics in higher education: A landscape analysis, New America, (2016); Friedler S.A., Choudhary S., Scheidegger C., Hamilton E.P., Venkatasubramanian S., Roth D., A comparative study of fairness-enhancing interventions in machine learning, Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (FAT∗ '19, pp. 329-338, (2019); Hutt S., Gardner M., Duckworth A.L., D'Mello S.K., Evaluating fairness and generalizability in models predicting on-time graduation from college applications, The 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining (EDM, pp. 79-88, (2019); Ishitani T.T., Studying attrition and degree completion behavior among first-generation college students in the united states, The Journal of Higher Education, 77, 5, pp. 861-885, (2006); Jayaprakash S.M., Moody E.W., Lauria E.J.M., Regan J.R., Baron J.D., Early alert of academically at-risk students: An open source analytics initiative, Journal of Learning Analytics, 1, 1, pp. 6-47, (2014); Park J., Yu R., Rodriguez F., Baker R., Smyth P., Warschauer M., Understanding student procrastination via mixture models, Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Educational Data Mining (EDM, pp. 187-197, (2018); Rudin C., Stop explaining black box machine learning models for high stakes decisions and use interpretable models instead, Nature Machine Intelligence, 1, 5, pp. 206-215, (2019); Yu R., Li Q., Fischer C., Doroudi S., Xu D., Towards accurate and fair prediction of college success: Evaluating different sources of student data, Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Educational Data Mining (EDM), (2020)",,,Association for Computing Machinery,,"7th Annual ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2020",12 August 2020 through 14 August 2020,"Virtual, Online",162054.0,,978-145037951-9,,,English,LS - Proc.

Interpretable Personalized Knowledge Tracing and Next Learning Activity Recommendation,2020,Full Paper,Work-in-Progress/Demonstration Session,"Online learning systems that provide actionable and personalized guidance can help learners make better decisions during learning. Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) extensions and deep learning based approaches have demonstrated improved mastery prediction accuracy compared to the basic BKT model; however, neither set of models provides actionable guidance on learning activities beyond mastery prediction. We propose a novel framework for personalized knowledge tracing with attention mechanism. Our proposed framework incorporates auxiliary learner attributes into knowledge tracing and interprets mastery prediction with the learning attributes. The proposed approach can also provide personalized next best learning activity recommendations. We demonstrate that the accuracy of the proposed approach in mastery prediction is slightly higher compared to deep learning based approaches and that the proposed approach can provide personalized next best learning activity recommendation. © 2020 ACM.",,,,,,100,Interpretable Personalized Knowledge Tracing and Next Learning Activity Recommendation,Zhao J.; Bhatt S.; Thille C.; Zimmaro D.; Gattani N.,"Zhao, Jinjin (57216820625); Bhatt, Shreyansh (55773429900); Thille, Candace (42062446600); Zimmaro, Dawn (16044237000); Gattani, Neelesh (57219709963)",57216820625; 55773429900; 42062446600; 16044237000; 57219709963,Interpretable Personalized Knowledge Tracing and Next Learning Activity Recommendation,2020.0,L@S 2020 - Proceedings of the 7th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,325,328,3.0,12.0,10.1145/3386527.3406739,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094919537&doi=10.1145%2f3386527.3406739&partnerID=40&md5=8bbdf8c9f72442c99e531921ddc1960b,"Amazon.com, Seattle, United States; Amazon.com, Austin, United States","Zhao J., Amazon.com, Seattle, United States; Bhatt S., Amazon.com, Seattle, United States; Thille C., Amazon.com, Seattle, United States; Zimmaro D., Amazon.com, Austin, United States; Gattani N., Amazon.com, Seattle, United States",attention mechanism; knowledge tracing; personalized knowledge tracing; recommendation,Deep learning; Forecasting; Online systems; Attention mechanisms; Bayesian knowledge tracings; Knowledge tracings; Learning Activity; Learning-based approach; On-line learning systems; Personalized guidance; Prediction accuracy; Learning systems,,,,,,,"Bhatt S., Zhao J., Thille C., Zimmaro D., Gattani N., A novel approach for knowledge state representation and prediction, Proceedings of the Seventh Annual Acm Conference on Learning at Scale, (2020); Corbett A.T., Anderson J.R., Knowledge tracing: Modeling the acquisition of procedural knowledge, User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction, 4, 4, pp. 253-278, (1994); Khajah M., Wing R., Lindsey R., Mozer M., Integrating latent-factor and knowledge-tracing models to predict individual differences in learning, Educational Data Mining, (2014); Lee J.I., Brunskill E., The impact on individualizing student models on necessary practice opportunities, International Educational Data Mining Society, (2012); Pardos Z.A., Heffernan N.T., Modeling individualization in a bayesian networks implementation of knowledge tracing, International Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation, and Personalization, pp. 255-266, (2010); Patikorn T., Heffernan N.T., Baker R.S., Assistments longitudinal data mining competition 2017: A preface, Proceedings of the Workshop on Scientific Findings from the ASSISTments Longitudinal Data Competition, International Conference on Educational Data Mining, (2018); Piech C., Bassen J., Huang J., Ganguli S., Sahami M., Guibas L.J., Sohl-Dickstein J., Deep knowledge tracing, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems., pp. 505-513, (2015); Su Y., Liu Q., Liu Q., Huang Z., Yin Y., Chen E., Ding C., Wei S., Hu G., Exercise-enhanced sequential modeling for student performance prediction, Thirty-Second Aaai Conference on Artificial Intelligence, (2018); Vaswani A., Shazeer N., Parmar N., Uszkoreit J., Jones L., Gomez A.N., Kaiser L., Polosukhin I., Attention is all you need, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems., pp. 5998-6008, (2017); Wang Z., Feng X., Tang J., Huang G.Y., Liu Z., Deep knowledge tracing with side information, International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education, pp. 303-308, (2019); Yeung C.-K., Yeung D.-Y., Addressing two problems in deep knowledge tracing via prediction-consistent regularization, Proceedings of the Fifth Annual Acm Conference on Learning at Scale, 5, (2018); Yudelson M.V., Koedinger K.R., Gordon G.J., Individualized bayesian knowledge tracing models, International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education, pp. 171-180, (2013); Zhang J., Shi X., King I., Yeung D.-Y., Dynamic key-value memory networks for knowledge tracing, Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on World Wide Web, pp. 765-774, (2017)",,,Association for Computing Machinery,,"7th Annual ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2020",12 August 2020 through 14 August 2020,"Virtual, Online",162054.0,,978-145037951-9,,,English,LS - Proc.

Introducing Alexa for E-learning,2020,Full Paper,Work-in-Progress/Demonstration Session,"E-learning is becoming popular as it provides learners the flexibility, targeted resources across the internet, personalized guidance, and immediate feedback during learning. However, lack of social interaction, an indispensable component in developing some skills, has been a pain point in e-learning. We propose using Alexa, a voice-controlled Intelligent Personal Assistants (IPA), in e-learning to provide in-person practice to achieve some desired learning goals. With Alexa enabled learning experiences, learners are able to practice with other students (one role of Alexa) or receive immediate feedback from teachers (another role of Alexa) in an e-learning environment. We propose a configuration driven conversation engine, which can support instructional designers to create diverse in-person practice opportunities in e-learning. We demonstrate that learning designers can create an Alexa activity with a few configuration steps. We also share results on the effectiveness of an Alexa activity with formative assessment evaluation in real world applications. © 2020 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,Introducing Alexa for E-learning,Zhao J.; Bhatt S.; Thille C.; Zimmaro D.; Gattani N.; Walker J.,"Zhao, Jinjin (57216820625); Bhatt, Shreyansh (55773429900); Thille, Candace (42062446600); Zimmaro, Dawn (16044237000); Gattani, Neelesh (57219709963); Walker, Josh (55547112593)",57216820625; 55773429900; 42062446600; 16044237000; 57219709963; 55547112593,Introducing Alexa for E-learning,2020.0,L@S 2020 - Proceedings of the 7th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,427,428,1.0,12.0,10.1145/3386527.3406719,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094873391&doi=10.1145%2f3386527.3406719&partnerID=40&md5=61169225cf5c6ee70a431eeb18e2aae6,"Amazon.com, Seattle, United States; Amazon.com, Austin, United States","Zhao J., Amazon.com, Seattle, United States; Bhatt S., Amazon.com, Seattle, United States; Thille C., Amazon.com, Seattle, United States; Zimmaro D., Amazon.com, Austin, United States; Gattani N., Amazon.com, Seattle, United States; Walker J., Amazon.com, Austin, United States",intelligent personal assistant; social interaction,E-learning; Feedback; Conversation engines; E-learning environment; Formative assessment; Instructional designer; Learning experiences; Personal assistants; Personalized guidance; Social interactions; Computer aided instruction,,,,,,,"Dizon G., Using intelligent personal assistants for second language learning: A case study of alexa, Tesol Journal, 8, 4, pp. 811-830, (2017); Dousay T.A., Hall C., Alexa, tell me about using a virtual assistant in the classroom, EdMedia+ Innovate Learning.

Learnersourcing at Scale to Overcome Expert Blind Spots for Introductory Programming: A Three-Year Deployment Study on the Python Tutor Website,2020,Full Paper,Work-in-Progress/Demonstration Session,"It is hard for experts to create good instructional resources due to a phenomenon known as the expert blind spot: They forget what it was like to be a novice, so they cannot pinpoint exactly where novices commonly struggle and how to best phrase their explanations. To help overcome these expert blind spots for computer programming topics, we created a learnersourcing system that elicits explanations of misconceptions directly from learners while they are coding. We have deployed this system for the past three years to the widely-used Python Tutor coding website (pythontutor.com) and collected 16,791 learner-written explanations. To our knowledge, this is the largest dataset of explanations for programming misconceptions. By inspecting this dataset, we found surprising insights that we did not originally think of due to our own expert blind spots as programming instructors. We are now using these insights to improve compiler and run-time error messages to explain common novice misconceptions. © 2020 ACM.",,,,,,100,Learnersourcing at Scale to Overcome Expert Blind Spots for Introductory Programming: A Three-Year Deployment Study on the Python Tutor Website,Guo P.J.; Markel J.M.; Zhang X.,"Guo, Philip J.

Learning to Cheat: Quantifying Changes in Score Advantage of Unproctored Assessments Over Time,2020,Full Paper,Session 5,"Proctoring educational assessments (e.g., quizzes and exams) has a cost, be it in faculty (and/or course staff) time or in money to pay for proctoring services. Previous estimates of the utility of proctoring (generally by estimating the score advantage of taking an exam without proctoring) vary widely and have mostly been implemented using an across subjects experimental designs and sometimes with low statistical power. We investigated the score advantage of unproctored exams versus proctored exams using a within-subjects design for N = 510 students in an on-campus introductory programming course with 5 proctored exams and 4 unproctored exams. We found that students scored 3.32 percentage points higher on questions on unproctored exams than on proctored exams (p < 0.001). More interestingly, however, we discovered that this score advantage on unproctored exams grew steadily as the semester progressed, from around 0 percentage points at the start of semester to around 7 percentage points by the end. As the most obvious explanation for this advantage is cheating, we refer to this behavior as the student population ""learning to cheat"". The data suggests that both more individuals are cheating and the average benefit of cheating is increasing over the course of the semester. Furthermore, we observed that studying for unproctored exams decreased over the course of the semester while studying for proctored exams stayed constant. Lastly, we estimated the score advantage by question type and found that our long-form programming questions had the highest score advantage on unproctored exams, but there are multiple possible explanations for this finding. © 2020 ACM.",,,,,,100,Learning to Cheat: Quantifying Changes in Score Advantage of Unproctored Assessments over Time,Chen B.; Azad S.; Fowler M.; West M.; Zilles C.,"Chen, Binglin (57194035737); Azad, Sushmita (57215658425); Fowler, Max (57190129692); West, Matthew (36867775200); Zilles, Craig (6602243123)",57194035737; 57215658425; 57190129692; 36867775200; 6602243123,Learning to Cheat: Quantifying Changes in Score Advantage of Unproctored Assessments over Time,2020.0,L@S 2020 - Proceedings of the 7th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,197,206,9.0,9.0,10.1145/3386527.3405925,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094876125&doi=10.1145%2f3386527.3405925&partnerID=40&md5=84c31f23ef60b60442e01ec685c9ffee,"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, United States","Chen B., University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, United States; Azad S., University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, United States; Fowler M., University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, United States; West M., University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, United States; Zilles C., University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, United States",assessment; cheating; cs1; exams; proctoring; stem,Students; Educational assessment; FORM programming; Introductory programming course; Percentage points; Question type; Statistical power; Student populations; Curricula,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF, (CMMI-1150490, DUE-1347722, DUE-1915257); University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, UIUC","This work was partially supported by NSF DUE-1347722, NSF CMMI-1150490, NSF DUE-1915257, and the College of Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign under the Strategic Instructional Initiatives Program (SIIP).","Bengtsson L., Take-home exams in higher education: A systematic review, Education Sciences, 9, 4, (2019); Cole M.T., Swartz L.B., Understanding academic integrity in the online learning environment: A survey of graduate and undergraduate business students, Asbbs Proceedings, 20, 1, (2013); Cressey D.R., Other People's Money; A Study of the Social Psychology of Embezzlement, (1953); Daffin L.W., Jones A.A., Comparing student performance on proctored and non-proctored exams in online psychology courses, Online Learning, 22, 1, pp. 131-145, (2018); Davis A.B., Rand R., Seay R., Remote proctoring: The effect of proctoring on grades, Advances in Accounting Education: Teaching and Curriculum Innovations.

Leveraging Book Indexes for Automatic Extraction of Concepts in MOOCs,2020,Full Paper,Work-in-Progress/Demonstration Session,"Concepts are basic elements in any learning module and are thus very useful for modeling, summarizing, and previewing the content of any module. Automatic extraction of the major concepts from online education materials enables many useful applications. In this paper, we propose to leverage textbooks and their back-of-the-book indexes as training data to train a supervised machine learning algorithm for automatic extraction of concepts from text data in the education domain. We evaluate this idea by training neural networks on three textbooks and applying the trained neural networks to extract concepts from the lecture transcripts of two MOOCs. Our results suggest great promise for further exploration of this direction. © 2020 ACM.",,,,,,100,Leveraging Book Indexes for Automatic Extraction of Concepts in MOOCs,Boughoula A.; San A.; Zhai C.,"Boughoula, Assma (57194033401); San, Aidan (57219715567); Zhai, ChengXiang (35232046000)",57194033401; 57219715567; 35232046000,Leveraging Book Indexes for Automatic Extraction of Concepts in MOOCs,2020.0,L@S 2020 - Proceedings of the 7th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,381,384,3.0,1.0,10.1145/3386527.3406749,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094915192&doi=10.1145%2f3386527.3406749&partnerID=40&md5=2cd9fba9e5cf2769c085fdb2ab066f80,"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, United States; University of Virginia, Charlottesville, United States","Boughoula A., University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, United States; San A., University of Virginia, Charlottesville, United States; Zhai C., University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, United States",back-of-the-book index; concept extraction; lstm; mooc; neural networks,Distance education; Extraction; Learning systems; Neural networks; Supervised learning; Textbooks; Automatic extraction; Basic elements; Education domain; Learning modules; On-line education; Supervised machine learning; Trained neural networks; Training data; Learning algorithms,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF; Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering, CISE, (1801652)",This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1801652.,"Csomai A., Mihalcea R., Investigations in unsupervised back-of-the-book indexing, Flairs Conference., pp. 211-216, (2007); Csomai A., Mihalcea R., Linguistically motivated features for enhanced back-of-the-book indexing, Proceedings of ACL-08: HLT., pp. 932-940, (2008); Jiang Z., Zhang Y., Li X., Moocon: A framework for semi-supervised concept extraction from mooc content, International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications, pp. 303-315, (2017); Kholghi M., Sitbon L., Zuccon G., Nguyen A., Active learning: A step towards automating medical concept extraction, Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, 23, 2, pp. 289-296, (2016); Meng R., Zhao S., Han S., He D., Brusilovsky P., Chi Y., Deep Keyphrase Generation, (2017); Naadan U.K., Geetha T.V., Kanimozhi U., Manjula D., Viswapriya R., Karthik C., A supervised learning to rank approach for dependency based concept extraction and repository based boosting for domain text indexing, International Conference on Applications of Natural Language to Information Systems, pp. 428-436, (2018); Wu Z., Li Z., Mitra P., Giles C.L., Can back-of-the-book indexes be automatically created?, Proceedings of the 22nd Acm International Conference on Information & Knowledge Management., pp. 1745-1750, (2013); Zhang Y., Fang Y., Weidong X., Deep keyphrase generation with a convolutional sequence to sequence model, 2017 4th International Conference on Systems and Informatics (ICSAI), pp. 1477-1485, (2017); Zhang Y., Xiao W., Keyphrase generation based on deep seq2seq model, Ieee Access, 6, pp. 46047-46057, (2018)",,,Association for Computing Machinery,,"7th Annual ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2020",12 August 2020 through 14 August 2020,"Virtual, Online",162054.0,,978-145037951-9,,,English,LS - Proc.

Open PISA: Dashboard for Large Educational Dataset,2020,Full Paper,Work-in-Progress/Demonstration Session,"International Large-Scale Assessments (ILSA) have a critical role in shaping education systems around the world. They impact local and national education policy and receive much attention in the media and the public discourse. However, the public has limited access to the results and cannot learn from them. Subsequently, the media might frame the results incorrectly. The transparency of ILSA is essential to the advancement of the public discourse. It requires easy access to data together with simple analysis tools. However, the complexity of ILSA makes it hard to understand and to analyze. Open PISA tries to deal with this challenge by developing a dashboard for the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA). It aims to guide users in the analysis of the dataset. This paper describes the dashboard design and insight based on collected users' responses. It hypothesizes that full transparency of the PISA dataset might be not achievable to the entire public. Further research is needed to evaluate how dataset analysis affects users' knowledge and opinions. © 2020 ACM.",,,,,,100,Open PISA: Dashboard for Large Educational Dataset,Kantor A.; Rafaeli S.,"Kantor, Avner (57219708180); Rafaeli, Sheizaf (6602722788)",57219708180; 6602722788,Open PISA: Dashboard for Large Educational Dataset,2020.0,L@S 2020 - Proceedings of the 7th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,253,256,3.0,2.0,10.1145/3386527.3406721,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094119335&doi=10.1145%2f3386527.3406721&partnerID=40&md5=0bf33dd43b646c9b185a02f67014d5db,"University of Haifa, Haifa, Israel","Kantor A., University of Haifa, Haifa, Israel; Rafaeli S., University of Haifa, Haifa, Israel",citizen science; dashboards; international large-scale assessments; pisa; statistical literacy; visualizations,Transparency; Data-set analysis; Education policies; Education systems; International students; Simple analysis; Large dataset,,,,,Trump Foundation,"Much appreciation to the people who provided helpful comments during the development of the dashboard design.

PARQR: Automatic Post Suggestion in the Piazza Online Forum to Support Degree Seeking Online Masters Students,2020,Full Paper,Session 3,"As enrollment numbers in online courses increase, students, instructors, and teaching assistants have difficulty finding needed information in online forums because of the number of posts, resulting in duplicate posts that exacerbate the problem. We introduce PARQR, a recommendation tool that suggests relevant contributions as participants compose their posts. We investigate the use of PARQR in five online degree-seeking courses. We survey 74 students and interview five teaching assistants to understand their experience with online forums and PARQR. We compare the differences between using and not using PARQR for an online course assignment. PARQR users found the tool to be useful for navigating online forums, and PARQR was effective in reducing the number of posts (0.291 vs. 0.506 posts per active student) and duplicate posts (17.8% vs. 25.6%) in an online course.

Peripheral and Semi-Peripheral Community: A New Design Challenge for Learning at Scale,2020,Full Paper,Work-in-Progress/Demonstration Session,"Existing attempts to foster a greater sense of community in online education have largely focused on direct interactions among students in peer review, forums, and other mechanisms. In this paper, we pose a new design challenge for learning at scale: peripheral community. Peripheral community is the sense of community derived from peripheral interactions in which a student has visibility into others' behaviors without a direct, intentional interaction occurring between the students. We argue for the value of peripheral community by examining opportunities for such visibility in residential learning environments. We then explore possible ways to supply peripheral community, both in the form of new initiatives and in reinterpretations of existing interventions as fostering peripheral community. © 2020 ACM.",,,,,,100,Peripheral and Semi-Peripheral Community: A New Design Challenge for Learning at Scale,Joyner D.A.,"Joyner, David A.

As a first step, we have collected and processed data on 9,044 applications and have trained a predictive model with a ROC-AUC score of 0.81, which predicts whether an applicant would be admitted to the program. Our next steps will include using applicant data to model the successful completion of the Analytics program's three core courses, graduation, and finally job placement. In addition, we plan to expand our feature processing and incorporate techniques to ensure that our models do not discriminate based on demographic factors. In the long run, we hope that the results of this study can be used to improve the course contents, selection of offered courses, and prerequisite training, and even give guidance toward the selection of the applicants. © 2020 ACM.",,,,,,100,Predicting Applicant Admission Status for Georgia Tech's Online Master's in Analytics Program,Staudaher S.; Lee J.; Soleimani F.,"Staudaher, Shawn (35504014300); Lee, Jeonghyun (57219710532); Soleimani, Farahnaz (57209041720)",35504014300; 57219710532; 57209041720,Predicting Applicant Admission Status for Georgia Tech's Online Master's in Analytics Program,2020.0,L@S 2020 - Proceedings of the 7th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,309,312,3.0,4.0,10.1145/3386527.3406735,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094893433&doi=10.1145%2f3386527.3406735&partnerID=40&md5=055e6a7090af13e59561e0068d826bed,"Sam Houston State University, Conroe, United States; Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, United States","Staudaher S., Sam Houston State University, Conroe, United States; Lee J., Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, United States; Soleimani F., Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, United States",applicant success; machine learning; predictive analytics,Application programs; Curricula; Core course; Course contents; Demographic factors; Feature processing; Georgia; Predictive modeling; Predictive analytics,,,,,,,"Bleske-Rechek A., Browne K., Trends in gre scores and graduate enrollments by gender and ethnicity, Intelligence, 46, pp. 25-34, (2014); Halberstam B., Redstone F., The predictive value of admissions materials on objective and subjective measures of graduate school performance in speech-language pathology, Journal of Higher Education Policy and Management, 27, 2, pp. 261-272, (2005); House J.D., Johnson J.J., Tolone W.L., Predictive validity of the graduate record examination for performance in selected graduate psychology courses, Psychological Reports, 60, 1, pp. 107-110, (1987); Ji C.-H.C., Predictive validity of the graduate record examination in education, Psychological Reports, 82, 3, pp. 899-904, (1998); Koys D.J., The validity of the graduate management admissions test for non-us students, Journal of Education for Business, 80, 4, pp. 236-239, (2005); Kuncel N.R., Crede M., Thomas L.L., A meta-Analysis of the predictive validity of the graduate management admission test (gmat) and undergraduate grade point average (ugpa) for graduate student academic performance, Academy of Management Learning & Education, 6, 1, pp. 51-68, (2007); Kuncel N.R., Wee S., Serafin L., Hezlett S.A., The validity of the graduate record examination for master's and doctoral programs: A meta-Analytic investigation, Educational and Psychological Measurement, 70, 2, pp. 340-352, (2010); Miller C.W., Admissions Criteria and Diversity in Graduate School, (2013); Nankervis B., Gender inequities in university admission due to the differential validity of the sat, Journal of College Admission, 213, pp. 24-30, (2011)",,,Association for Computing Machinery,,"7th Annual ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2020",12 August 2020 through 14 August 2020,"Virtual, Online",162054.0,,978-145037951-9,,,English,LS - Proc.

Sensing Affect to Empower Students: Learner Perspectives on Affect-Sensitive Technology in Large Educational Contexts,2020,Full Paper,Session 2,"Large-scale educational settings have been common domains for affect detection and recognition research. Most research emphasizes improvements in the accuracy of affect measurement to enhance instructors' efficiency in managing large numbers of students. However, these technologies are not designed from students' perspectives, nor designed for students' own usage. To identify the unique design considerations for affect sensors that consider student capacities and challenges, and explore the potential of affect sensors to support students' self-learning, we conducted semi-structured interviews and surveys with both online students and on-campus students enrolled in large in-person classes. Drawing on these studies we: (a) propose using affect data to support students' self-regulated learning behaviors through a ""scaling for empowerment""design perspective, (b) identify design guidelines to mitigate students' concerns regarding the use of affect data at scale, (c) provide design recommendations for the physical design of affect sensors for large educational settings. © 2020 ACM.",,,,,,100,Sensing Affect to Empower Students: Learner Perspectives on Affect-Sensitive Technology in Large Educational Contexts,Wang Q.; Jing S.; Joyner D.; Wilcox L.; Li H.; Plötz T.; Disalvo B.,"Wang, Qiaosi (57210419209); Jing, Shan (57203369167); Joyner, David (35183234600); Wilcox, Lauren (23040470800); Li, Hong (57204733985); Plötz, Thomas (6507872294); Disalvo, Betsy (26036358000)",57210419209; 57203369167; 35183234600; 23040470800; 57204733985; 6507872294; 26036358000,Sensing Affect to Empower Students: Learner Perspectives on Affect-Sensitive Technology in Large Educational Contexts,2020.0,L@S 2020 - Proceedings of the 7th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,63,76,13.0,35.0,10.1145/3386527.3405917,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094883876&doi=10.1145%2f3386527.3405917&partnerID=40&md5=af48a2cdeb1bded93574f46b0371c9b8,"Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, United States","Wang Q., Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, United States; Jing S., Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, United States; Joyner D., Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, United States; Wilcox L., Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, United States; Li H., Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, United States; Plötz T., Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, United States; Disalvo B., Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, United States",affective computing; design; education; privacy; self-regulated learning; sensor design,Design; Design considerations; Design recommendations; Educational context; Educational settings; Self-regulated learning behaviors; Semi structured interviews; Sensitive technology; Students' perspectives; Students,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF, (1842693)",We would like to thank our study participants for their participation in our study.

Student Engagement in Mobile Learning via Text Message,2020,Full Paper,Session 4,"Mobile learning is expanding rapidly due to its accessibility and affordability, especially in resource-poor parts of the world. Yet how students engage and learn with mobile learning has not been systematically analyzed at scale. This study examines how 93,819 Kenyan students in grades 6, 9, and 12 use a text message-based mobile learning platform that has millions of users across Sub-Saharan Africa. We investigate longitudinal variation in engagement over a one-year period for students in different age groups and check for evidence of learning gains using learning curve analysis. Student engagement is highest during school holidays and leading up to standardized exams, but persistence over time is low: under 25% of students return to the platform after joining. Clustering students into three groups based on their level of activity, we examine variation in their learning behaviors and quiz performance over their first ten days. Highly active students exhibit promising trends in terms of quiz completion, reattempts, and accuracy, but we do not see evidence of learning gains in this study. The findings suggest that students in Kenya use mobile learning either as an ad-hoc resource or a low-cost tutor to complement formal schooling and bridge gaps in instruction. © 2020 ACM.",,,,,,100,Student Engagement in Mobile Learning via Text Message,Kizilcec R.F.; Chen M.,"Kizilcec, René F.

Students' Achievement of Personalized Learning Objectives in MOOCs,2020,Full Paper,Session 4,"Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) provide the opportunity to offer free and open education at scale. Thousands of students with different social and cultural backgrounds from all over the world can enroll for a course. This diverse audience comes with varying motivations and intentions from their personal or professional life. However, course instructors cannot offer individual support and guidance at this scale and therefore usually provide a one-size-fits-all approach. Students have to follow weekly-structured courses and their success is measured with the achievement of a certificate at the end. To better address the varying learning needs, technical support for goal-oriented and self-regulated learning is desired but very limited to date. Both learning strategies are proven to be key factors for students' achievement in large-scale online learning environments. Therefore, this paper presents a continuative study of personalized learning objectives in MOOCs to encourage goal-oriented and self-regulated learning. Based on the previously well-perceived acceptance and usefulness of the concept of personalized learning objectives, this study examines which learners select an objective and how successful they complete objectives. Concerning the learners' socio-demographic and geographical background, we could not identify any practical significant difference between students with selected learning objectives and the total course population. However, we have identified promising objective achievement rates, and we have observed a practical significant improvement of the certification rates comparing the total course population and students who selected an objective that included a graded certificate. This has also demonstrated a method for calculating more reasonable completion rates in MOOCs. © 2020 ACM.",,,,,,100,Students' Achievement of Personalized Learning Objectives in MOOCs,Rohloff T.; Sauer D.; Meinel C.,"Rohloff, Tobias (57190375445); Sauer, Dominic (57210727270); Meinel, Christoph (56187776800)",57190375445; 57210727270; 56187776800,Students' Achievement of Personalized Learning Objectives in MOOCs,2020.0,L@S 2020 - Proceedings of the 7th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,147,156,9.0,7.0,10.1145/3386527.3405918,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094875675&doi=10.1145%2f3386527.3405918&partnerID=40&md5=8eb5a772178bd7495d5b454bcff5ad00,"Hasso Plattner Institute, Potsdam, Germany","Rohloff T., Hasso Plattner Institute, Potsdam, Germany; Sauer D., Hasso Plattner Institute, Potsdam, Germany; Meinel C., Hasso Plattner Institute, Potsdam, Germany",learning objectives; moocs; self-regulated learning,Air navigation; Computer aided instruction; Curricula; Students; Cultural backgrounds; Learning objectives; Massive open online course; Online learning environment; Personalized learning; Professional life; Self-regulated learning; Technical support; E-learning,,,,,,,"Breslow L.B., Pritchard D.E., DeBoer J., Stump G.S., Ho A.D., Seaton D.T., Studying learning in the worldwide classroom: Research into edx's first mooc, Research & Practice in Assessment, 8, pp. 13-25, (2013); Broadbent J., Poon W., Self-regulated learning strategies & academic achievement in online higher education learning environments: A systematic review, The Internet and Higher Education, 27, 4, (2015); Doran G.T., There's a smart way to write management's goals and objectives, Management Review, 70, 11, pp. 35-36, (1981); Grella C., Meinel C., Moocs as a promoter of gender diversity in stem?, Proceedings of the 12th International Scientific Conference ELearning and Software for Education, (2016); Henderikx M., Kreijns K., Kalz M., Refining success and dropout in massive open online courses based on the intention-behavior gap, Distance Education, 38, (2017); Kizilcec R.F., Perez-Sanagustin M., Maldonado J.J., Self-regulated learning strategies predict learner behavior and goal attainment in massive open online courses, Comput.

Studying Retrieval Practice in an Intelligent Tutoring System,2020,Full Paper,Session 2,"Retrieval practice (also known as testing effect or test-enhanced learning) is a well-studied and established technique for improving the retention of knowledge. Many previous works have confirmed the benefits of retrieval practice in laboratory experiments involving the memorization of words or facts. In this study, we build on these works and analyze retrieval practice in an intelligent tutoring system. Using a large data set composed of the actions of almost 4 million students studying math and chemistry, we look at the possible benefits of retrieval practice in the ALEKS adaptive learning and assessment system. We compare two different types of retrieval practice-one involving the assessment of learned material, and another involving the learning of closely related content that builds on the learned material-leveraging the scale of the available data to control for several confounding variables. Finally, we look at the timing of retrieval practice within the system and the possible effect it has on forgetting. The results indicate that a delay in retrieval practice is associated with better retention and that, while being assessed on learned material is beneficial, the learning of closely related content is associated with an even higher rate of retention. © 2020 ACM.",,,,,,100,Studying Retrieval Practice in an Intelligent Tutoring System,Matayoshi J.; Uzun H.; Cosyn E.,"Matayoshi, Jeffrey (53877899300); Uzun, Hasan (7004285756); Cosyn, Eric (6506356308)",53877899300; 7004285756; 6506356308,Studying Retrieval Practice in an Intelligent Tutoring System,2020.0,L@S 2020 - Proceedings of the 7th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,51,62,11.0,6.0,10.1145/3386527.3405927,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094877328&doi=10.1145%2f3386527.3405927&partnerID=40&md5=6557d6c64d6647a76fa2f00f1b647a08,"McGraw Hill Aleks, United States","Matayoshi J., McGraw Hill Aleks, United States; Uzun H., McGraw Hill Aleks, United States; Cosyn E., McGraw Hill Aleks, United States",forgetting curves; generalized estimating equations; intelligent tutoring system; knowledge space theory; marginal model; retrieval practice,Computer aided instruction; Education computing; Well testing; Adaptive learning; Assessment system; Enhanced learning; In-laboratory experiments; Intelligent tutoring system; Large datasets; Related content; Testing effects; Search engines,,,,,,,"Adesope O.O., Trevisan D.A., Sundararajan N., Rethinking the use of tests: A meta-Analysis of practice testing, Review of Educational Research, 87, 3, pp. 659-701, (2017); Agarwal P.K., Bain P.M., Chamberlain R.W., The value of applied research: Retrieval practice improves classroom learning and recommendations from a teacher, a principal, and a scientist, Educational Psychology Review, 24, pp. 437-448, (2012); Akaike H., A new look at the statistical model identification, Ieee Trans.

The Effect of Informing Agency in Self-Directed Online Learning Environments,2020,Full Paper,Session 2,"Choices learners make when navigating a self-directed online learning tool can impact the effectiveness of the experience. But these tools often do not afford learners the agency or the information to make decisions beneficial to their learning. We evaluated the effect of varying levels of information and agency in a self-directed environment designed to teach programming. We investigated three design alternatives: informed high-agency, informed low-agency, and less informed high-agency. To investigate the effect of these alternatives on learning, we conducted a study with 79 novice programmers. Our results indicated that increased agency and information may have translated to more motivation, but not improved learning. Qualitative results suggest this was due to the burden that agency and information placed on decision-making. We interpret our results in relation to informing the design of self-directed online tools for learner agency. © 2020 ACM.",,,,,,100,The Effect of Informing Agency in Self-Directed Online Learning Environments,Xie B.; Nelson G.L.; Akkaraju H.; Kwok W.; Ko A.J.,"Xie, Benjamin (57195928948); Nelson, Greg L.

The Effectiveness of Multiple-Choice Type Flashcards for the Identification of Fish Species,2020,Full Paper,Work-in-Progress/Demonstration Session,"Mobile learning apps such as Duolingo have allowed millions of students to study new subjects that they might not otherwise be able to. One study mode utilized in mobile learning is a digital ""flashcard,""a tool used by students for studying and memorizing content both in and out of the traditional classroom. Here I investigate whether a multiple-choice type flashcard, which asks the user to identify the picture from one of 4 options, performs better than a digital flashcard to help users identify pictures of fake, cartoon fish. The results of the study so far are inconclusive, not finding statistically significant differences in quiz scores between participants who use the standard flashcards and those who used the multiple-choice flashcard. However, the results may indicate that participants who studied using the multiple-choice flashcard achieved similar scores while studying less on average than those who studied using the standard flashcards. © 2020 ACM.",,,,,,100,The Effectiveness of Multiple-Choice Type Flashcards for the Identification of Fish Species,Kerman I.,"Kerman, Ian (57508232100)",57508232100,The Effectiveness of Multiple-Choice Type Flashcards for the Identification of Fish Species,2020.0,L@S 2020 - Proceedings of the 7th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,405,408,3.0,1.0,10.1145/3386527.3406753,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094891774&doi=10.1145%2f3386527.3406753&partnerID=40&md5=18516736f221b96a0412ff3d2aea4446,"Georgia Institute of Technology and Dassault Systèmes Biovia, Atlanta, United States","Kerman I., Georgia Institute of Technology and Dassault Systèmes Biovia, Atlanta, United States",elearning; flashcards; learning at scale; mobile learning,Fish; Students; Fish species; Mobile Learning; Multiple choice; Statistically significant difference; E-learning,,,,,,,"Sports & Fitness Industry Association, (2017); Pipeline Pilot Release 2020.

"The Role of Self-Regulated Learning in the Design, Implementation, and Evaluation of Learning Analytics Dashboards",2020,Full Paper,Work-in-Progress/Demonstration Session,"Learning technologies are generating a vast quantity of data every day. This data is often presented to students through learning analytics dashboards (LADs) with a goal of improving learners' self-regulated learning. However, are students actually using these dashboards, and do they perceive that using dashboards lead to any changes in their behavior? In this paper we report on the development and implementation of several dashboard views, which we call My Learning Analytics (MyLA). This study found that students thought using the dashboard would have more of an effect on the way they planned their course activity at pre-use (after a demo) than post use. Low self-regulated learners believed so significantly less post-use and used the grade distribution view the least. Students made several suggestions for ways to improve the grade distribution view and rated MyLA's usability more positively at pre-than post-use. Given the low use and low perceived impact of the current dashboard, we suggest that researchers use participatory design to illicit students' needs and better incorporate student suggestions. © 2020 ACM.",,,,,,100,"The Role of Self-Regulated Learning in the Design, Implementation, and Evaluation of Learning Analytics Dashboards",Haynes C.C.,"Haynes, Carl C.

The Synchronicity Paradox in Online Education,2020,Full Paper,Session 1,"As online education proliferates, one concern that has been raised is that it may fail to capture desirable emergent phe-nomena from on-campus programs. Student community is one example of such a phenomenon: on-campus student communities thrive based on synchronous collocation. An online program might be designed to capture all deliberate constructs in an on-campus program, but there may be beneficial side effects of synchronous collocation that are not apparent. In this work, we examine the issue of social isolation in an online graduate program. By happenstance, three studies were conducted in relative isolation looking at social isolation from different angles. The first study exam-ined trajectories in social presence as a semester proceeded. The second study developed an understanding of students' needs with regard to community in an online program. The third study tested out an immersive virtual environment to try to improve students' sense of connectedness. Combin-ing their findings, we find compelling evidence of the exist-ence of a Synchronicity Paradox in online education: stu-dents desire synchronicity to form strong social communi-ties, and yet part of the chief appeal of these online pro-grams is their asynchronicity. In light of this finding, we provide design guidelines for how synchronicity may be reintroduced into asynchronous programs without sacrific-ing the benefits of asynchronicity. More specifically, we propose that scale itself may be the key to building emer-gent synchronicity. © 2020 ACM.",,,,,,100,The Synchronicity Paradox in Online Education,Joyner D.A.; Wang Q.; Thakare S.; Jing S.; Goel A.; MacIntyre B.,"Joyner, David A.

Toward Learning at Scale in Developing Countries: Lessons from the Global Learning XPRIZE Field Study,2020,Full Paper,Session 5,"Advances in education technology are enabling tremendous advances in learning at scale. However, they typically assume resources taken for granted in developed countries, including reliable electricity, high-bandwidth Internet access, fast WiFi, powerful computers, sophisticated sensors, and expert technical support to keep it all working. This paper examines these assumptions in the context of a massive test of learning at scale in a developing country. We examine each assumption, how it was broken, and some workarounds used in a 15-month-long independent controlled evaluation of pre-to posttest learning and social-emotional gains by over 2,000 children in 168 villages in Tanzania. We analyze those gains to characterize who gained how much, using test score data, social-emotional measures, and detailed logs from RoboTutor. We quantify the relative impact of pretest scores, literate aspirations, treatment, and usage on learning gains. © 2020 ACM.",,,,,,100,Toward Learning at Scale in Developing Countries: Lessons from the Global Learning XPRIZE Field Study,McReynolds A.A.; Naderzad S.P.; Goswami M.; Mostow J.,"McReynolds, Andrew A.

Towards Crowdsourcing the Identification of Knowledge Components,2020,Full Paper,Work-in-Progress/Demonstration Session,"Assigning a set of hypothesized knowledge components (KCs) to assessment items within an ed-tech system enables us to better estimate student learning. However, creating and assigning these KCs is a time-consuming process that often requires domain expertise. In this study, we present the results of crowdsourcing KCs for problems in the domain of mathematics and English writing, as a first step in leveraging the crowd to expedite this task. Crowdworkers were presented with a problem and asked to provide the underlying skills required to solve it. Additionally, we investigated the effect of priming crowdworkers with related content before having them generate these KCs. We then analyzed their contributions through qualitative coding and found that across both the math and writing domains roughly 33% of the crowdsourced KCs directly matched those generated by domain experts for the same problems. © 2020 ACM.",,,,,,100,Towards Crowdsourcing the Identification of Knowledge Components,Moore S.; Nguyen H.A.; Stamper J.,"Moore, Steven (57145946000); Nguyen, Huy A.

"Towards an Appropriate Query, Key, and Value Computation for Knowledge Tracing",2020,Full Paper,Work-in-Progress/Demonstration Session,"In this paper, we propose a novel Transformer-based model for knowledge tracing, SAINT: Separated Self-AttentIve Neural Knowledge Tracing. SAINT has an encoder-decoder structure where the exercise and response embedding sequences separately enter, respectively, the encoder and the decoder. The encoder applies self-attention layers to the sequence of exercise embeddings, and the decoder alternately applies self-attention layers and encoder-decoder attention layers to the sequence of response embeddings. This separation of input allows us to stack attention layers multiple times, resulting in an improvement in area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to suggest an encoder-decoder model for knowledge tracing that applies deep self-attentive layers to exercises and responses separately. We empirically evaluate SAINT on a large-scale knowledge tracing dataset, EdNet, collected by an active mobile education application, Santa, which has 627,347 users, 72,907,005 response data points as well as a set of 16,175 exercises gathered since 2016. The results show that SAINT achieves state-of-the-art performance in knowledge tracing with an improvement of 1.8% in AUC compared to the current state-of-the-art model. © 2020 ACM.",,,,,,100,"Towards an Appropriate Query, Key, and Value Computation for Knowledge Tracing",Choi Y.; Lee Y.; Cho J.; Baek J.; Kim B.; Cha Y.; Shin D.; Bae C.; Heo J.,"Choi, Youngduck (57218279963); Lee, Youngnam (57218279287); Cho, Junghyun (57218280332); Baek, Jineon (57218285675); Kim, Byungsoo (57218284065); Cha, Yeongmin (57219712376); Shin, Dongmin (57218283487); Bae, Chan (57218277466); Heo, Jaewe (57218283187)",57218279963; 57218279287; 57218280332; 57218285675; 57218284065; 57219712376; 57218283487; 57218277466; 57218283187,"Towards an Appropriate Query, Key, and Value Computation for Knowledge Tracing",2020.0,L@S 2020 - Proceedings of the 7th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,341,344,3.0,76.0,10.1145/3386527.3405945,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094886691&doi=10.1145%2f3386527.3405945&partnerID=40&md5=6115282810de7be8bb5376f29b9be020,"Riiid!

"Two Stances, Three Genres, and Four Intractable Dilemmas for the Future of Learning at Scale",2020,Full Paper,Session 1,"The late 2000s and 2010s saw the full arc of a dramatic hype cycle in learning at scale, where charismatic technologists made bold and ultimately unfounded predictions about how technologies would disrupt schooling systems. Looking toward the 2020s, a more productive approach to learning at scale is the tinkerer's stance, one that emphasizes incremental improvements on the long history of learning at scale. This article offers two organizational constructs for navigating and building on that history. Classifying learning-at-scale technologies into three genres-instructor-guided, algorithm-guided, and peer-guided approaches-helps identify how emerging technologies build on prior efforts and throws into relief that which is genuinely new. Four as-yet intractable dilemmas-the curse of the familiar, the edtech Matthew effect, the trap of routine assessment, and the toxic power of data and experiments-offer a set of grand challenges that learning-at-scale tinkerers will need to tackle in order to see more dramatic improvements in school systems. © 2020 ACM.",,,,,,100,"Two Stances, Three Genres, and Four Intractable Dilemmas for the Future of Learning at Scale",Reich J.,"Reich, Justin (56144824600)",56144824600,"Two Stances, Three Genres, and Four Intractable Dilemmas for the Future of Learning at Scale",2020.0,L@S 2020 - Proceedings of the 7th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,3,13,10.0,5.0,10.1145/3386527.3405929,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094904829&doi=10.1145%2f3386527.3405929&partnerID=40&md5=7cc34076a73896d64f4ca869ec7f97c2,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, United States","Reich J., Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, United States",adaptive tutors; learning at scale; moocs; peer learning; synthesis,Learning systems; Emerging technologies; Grand Challenge; Incremental improvements; Looking toward; Matthew effects; School systems; Engineering education,,,,,,,"Elena Alonso-Mencia M., Et al., Self-regulated learning in moocs: Lessons learned from a literature review, Educational Review, pp. 1-27, (2019); Ames M., The Charisma Machine: The Life, Death and Legacy of One Laptop per Child, (2019); Atkinson R.C., Wilson H.A., Computer-Assisted instruction, Science, 162, 3849, pp. 73-77, (1968); Baker F.B., Computer-based instructional management systems: A first look, Review of Educational Research, 41, 1, pp. 51-70, (1971); Bali M., Mooc pedagogy: Gleaning good practice from existing moocs, Journal of Online Learning and Teaching, 10, 1, (2014); Bernard R.M., Abrami P.C., Lou Y., Borokhovski E., Wade A., Wozney L., Huang B., How does distance education compare with classroom instruction?

Understanding Learner Behavior Through Learning Design Informed Learning Analytics,2020,Full Paper,Session 4,"A goal of learning analytics is to inform and improve learning design. Previous studies have attempted to interpret learners' clickstream data based on learning science theories. Many of these interpretations are made without reference to the specific learning designs of the courses being analyzed. Here, we report on a learning design informed analytics exploration of an introductory MOOC on Computer Science and Python programming. The learning resources (videos) and practice resources (short exercises and problem sets) are analyzed according to the knowledge types and cognitive process levels respectively, both based on a revised Bloom's Taxonomy. A heat map visualization of the access intensity on a learner resource access transition matrix and social network analysis are used to analyze learners' behavior with respect to the different resource categories. The results show distinctively different patterns of access between groups of students with different course performance and different academic backgrounds. © 2020 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,Understanding Learner Behavior through Learning Design Informed Learning Analytics,Shen H.;

Understanding Reading Behaviors of Middle School Students,2020,Full Paper,Work-in-Progress/Demonstration Session,"Rich models of students' learning and problem-solving behaviors can support tailored interventions by instructors and scaffolding of complex learning activities. Our goal in this paper is to identify students' reading behaviors as they engage with instructional texts in domain-specific activities. In this work, we apply theory and methodology from the learning sciences to a large-scale middle school dataset within a digital literacy platform, Actively Learn. We compare students' reading behaviors both within and across domains for 12,566 science and 16,240 social studies students. Our findings show that higher-performing students in science engaged in more metacognitively-rich reading activities, such as text annotation; whereas lower-performing students relied more on simple highlighting and took longer to respond to embedded questions. Higher-performing students in social studies, by contrast, engaged more with the vocabulary and took longer to read before attempting question responses. Our finding may be used as recommendations to help both teachers and students engage in and support more effective behaviors. © 2020 ACM.",,,,,,100,Understanding Reading Behaviors of Middle School Students,Farhana E.; Rutherford T.; Lynch C.F.,"Farhana, Effat (36630171600); Rutherford, Teomara (53878305800); Lynch, Collin F.

Understanding Student Experience: A Pathways Model,2020,Full Paper,Work-in-Progress/Demonstration Session,"As universities increasingly teach at scale, new challenges are introduced and compounded where students are offered greater choice. A key challenge is to maintain an understanding of the student experience within the huge increase in variations in student study path. This understanding is necessary to provide feedback to both faculty and students, and institutionally for the enhancement of quality. This is the first description of one fresh approach to this challenge. Whilst based on the experience within a large distance learning university, the findings are relevant to all institutions working at scale. Moving from a traditional relational structure to a multi-model database makes it possible to quickly design study path queries to explore the richness of available data.

Understanding the Implications of the Use of Intelligent Tutoring Systems in Driver Training,2020,Full Paper,Work-in-Progress/Demonstration Session,"Effective driver education techniques can greatly benefit from the use of state-of-the-art technologies for driving training and tutoring in classroom environment. Such environment includes simulation systems that are designed based on the Intelligent Tutoring System concepts and framework. This research analyzed simulator data for both simulation and vehicle environments to identify factors for driver training guidelines. Based on the results of this study, one of the recommendations is that current ITS based driver training systems be calibrated to accurately measure the steering input which is found to be the most significant parameter influencing time headway (distances between simulated vehicles). The findings also support the modern intelligent tutoring system used at scale that leverages human feedback to improve their design. © 2020 ACM.",,,,,,100,Understanding the Implications of the Use of Intelligent Tutoring Systems in Driver Training,Ekram A.-A.,"Ekram, Al-Ahad (57219714697)",57219714697,Understanding the Implications of the Use of Intelligent Tutoring Systems in Driver Training,2020.0,L@S 2020 - Proceedings of the 7th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,421,424,3.0,0.0,10.1145/3386527.3406756,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094904904&doi=10.1145%2f3386527.3406756&partnerID=40&md5=807d5ab74a0bcb3aebc1ee4fcc778169,"Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, United States","Ekram A.-A., Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, United States",acc; autonomous vehicle; driving training; intelligent tutoring system; its; lkas,Computer aided instruction; Education computing; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Traffic control; Classroom environment; Driver education; Driving trainings; Intelligent tutoring system; Simulated vehicles; Simulation systems; State-of-the-art technology; Training Systems; Driver training,,,,,,,"Adler J.L., List G.F., Menyuk B., Cetin M., Advanced educational technologies and intelligent transportation systems training: State of the practice, Transp.

Using Google Search Trends to Estimate Global Patterns in Learning,2020,Full Paper,Session 5,"The use of the Internet for learning provides a unique and growing opportunity to revisit the task of quantifying how much people have learned about a given subject in different regions around the world. Google alone receives over 5 billion searches a day and its publicly available data provides insight into learning process that is otherwise unobservable on a global scale. In this paper we, introduce the Computer Science Literacy-Proxy Index via Search (CSLI-s), a measure that utilizes online search data to make an educated guess around trends in computer science education. This measure uses a statistical signal processing technique to compose search volumes from a spectrum of topics into a coherent score. We intentionally explore and mitigate the biases of search data and, in the process, develop CSLI-s scores that correlate with traditional, more expensive metrics of learning.

"Using Information Visualization to Promote Students' Reflection on ""Gaming the System"" in Online Learning",2020,Full Paper,Session 2,"""Gaming the system""is the phenomenon where students attempt to perform well by systematically exploiting properties of the learning system, rather than learning the material. Frequent gaming tends to cause bad learning outcomes. Though existing studies tackle the problem by redesigning the system workflow to change students' behaviors automatically, gaming students discover new ways to game. We instead propose a novel way, reflective nudge, to reflectively influence students' attitudes by conveying reasons not to game via information visualizations. Particularly, we identify three common gaming contexts and involve students and instructors in co-designing three context-specific persuasive visualizations. We deploy our information visualizations in a real online learning platform. Through embedded surveys and in-person interviews, we find some evidence that the designs can promote students' reflection on gaming, and suggestive data that two of them can reduce gaming compared with control groups. Furthermore, we present insights into reflective nudge designs and practical issues concerning deployment. © 2020 ACM.",,,,,,100,"Using Information Visualization to Promote Students' Reflection on ""gaming the System"" in Online Learning",Xia M.;

Where's the Learning in Education Crowdsourcing?  305-308,2020,Full Paper,Work-in-Progress/Demonstration Session,"Crowdsourcing has shown promise in education domains. For example, researchers have leveraged the wisdom of the crowd to process grading in MOOCs and develop learning resources. An untapped domain is harnessing the crowd to systematically process educational data in classrooms-data that provide key instructional insights but take time to process, such as paper-based assessments. In this paper, we describe an experiment of a crowdsourcing task to effectively process classroom-based data and explore the potential of crowdsourcing as a learning opportunity for the crowdworkers.

A Machine Learning Approach for Suggesting Feedback in Textual Exercises in Large Courses,2021,Full Paper,L@Scale 4: Perspectives from Europe and US,"Open-ended textual exercises facilitate the comprehension of problem-solving skills. Students can learn from their mistakes when teachers provide individual feedback. However, courses with hundreds of students cause a heavy workload for teachers: providing individual feedback is mostly a manual, repetitive, and time-consuming activity. This paper presents CoFee, a machine learning approach designed to suggest computer-aided feedback in open-ended textual exercises. The approach uses topic modeling to split student answers into text segments and language embeddings to transform these segments. It then applies clustering to group the text segments by similarity so that the same feedback can be applied to all segments within the same cluster. We implemented this approach in a reference implementation called Athene and integrated it into Artemis. We used Athene to review 17 textual exercises in two large courses at the Technical University of Munich with 2,300 registered students and 53 teachers. On average, Athene suggested feedback for 26% of the submissions. Accordingly, 85% of these suggestions were accepted by the teachers, 5% were extended with a comment and then accepted, and 10% were changed. © 2021 ACM.",,,,,,100,A Machine Learning Approach for Suggesting Feedback in Textual Exercises in Large Courses,Bernius J.P.; Krusche S.; Bruegge B.,"Bernius, Jan Philip (57206656267); Krusche, Stephan (55533679200); Bruegge, Bernd (6603874399)",57206656267; 55533679200; 6603874399,A Machine Learning Approach for Suggesting Feedback in Textual Exercises in Large Courses,2021.0,L@S 2021 - Proceedings of the 8th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,173,182,9.0,8.0,10.1145/3430895.3460135,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108123395&doi=10.1145%2f3430895.3460135&partnerID=40&md5=891c562b926299496a9ccbf5e2e24e2e,"Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany","Bernius J.P., Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany; Krusche S., Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany; Bruegge B., Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany",assessment support system; automatic assessment; education; feedback; grading; interactive learning; learning; software engineering,Computer aided instruction; Machine learning; Modeling languages; Problem solving; Students; Turing machines; Computer aided; Heavy workloads; Machine learning approaches; Problem solving skills; Reference implementation; Technical universities; Text segments; Topic Modeling; Teaching,,,,,,,"Alario-Hoyos C., Kloos C., Estvez-Ayres M., Fernidez-Panadero C., Blasco J., Pastrana S., Villena-Romi J., Interactive activities: The key to learning programming with moocs, European Stakeholder Summit on Experiences and Best Practices in and around MOOCs, 319, (2016); Anderson L.W., Krathwohl D.R., Airasian P.W., Cruikshank K.A., Mayer R.E., Pintrich P.R., Raths J., Wittrock M.C., A taxonomy for learning, teaching, and assessing: A revision of bloom's taxonomy of educational objectives, Longmans Green, (2001); Basu S., Jacobs C., Vanderwende L., Powergrading: A clustering approach to amplify human effort for short answer grading, Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 1, (2013); Bernius J.P., Toward computer-Aided assessment of textual exercises in very large courses, 52nd Acm Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE '21)., 1386, (2021); Bernius J.P., Bruegge B., Toward the automatic assessment of text exercises, 2nd Workshop on Innovative Software Engineering Education.

A Novel Framework for Discovering Cognitive Models of Learning,2021,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"A cognitive model is a descriptive account or computational representation of human thinking about a given concept, skill, or domain. A cognitive model of learning, includes both a way of organizing knowledge within a subject area and an account of how humans develop accurate and complete knowledge of that subject area. Learning designers engage in a variety of practices to unpack knowledge from subject matter experts and novices to develop cognitive models of learning and use those models to guide the design of instruction or instructional technologies. Traditional approaches to eliciting and organizing knowledge, such as conducting a cognitive task analysis (CTA) [10] with experts and novices, are labor-intensive and require specific expertise that many learning designers do not have. However, learning data generated from learners' interaction with the courses, reveal how humans think about and develop knowledge. We propose a novel framework that uses learning data to discover and refine cognitive models of learning. The framework includes a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) module and a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) module. We provide one case study in a corporate setting to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework compared to other approaches. © 2021 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,A Novel Framework for Discovering Cognitive Models of Learning,Zhao J.; Thille C.; Gattani N.; Zimmaro D.,"Zhao, Jinjin (57216820625); Thille, Candace (42062446600); Gattani, Neelesh (57219709963); Zimmaro, Dawn (16044237000)",57216820625; 42062446600; 57219709963; 16044237000,A Novel Framework for Discovering Cognitive Models of Learning,2021.0,L@S 2021 - Proceedings of the 8th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,271,274,3.0,0.0,10.1145/3430895.3460156,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108075141&doi=10.1145%2f3430895.3460156&partnerID=40&md5=b4c97d4934adae9365337a89032b2cc1,"Amazon.com, Seattle, WA, United States; Amazon.com, Austin, TX, United States","Zhao J., Amazon.com, Seattle, WA, United States; Thille C., Amazon.com, Seattle, WA, United States; Gattani N., Amazon.com, Seattle, WA, United States; Zimmaro D., Amazon.com, Austin, TX, United States",cognitive modeling; human-computer interaction; human-in-the-loop; knowledge tracing simulation; variational autoencoder,Gaussian distribution; Job analysis; Cognitive model; Cognitive task analysis; Gaussian Mixture Model; Human thinking; Instructional technology; Labor intensive; Subject matter experts; Traditional approaches; Learning systems,,,,,,,"Cen H., Koedinger K., Junker B., Learning factors analysis-A general method for cognitive model evaluation and improvement, International Conference on Intelligent Tutoring Systems, pp. 164-175, (2006); Edward Clark R., Elen J., Handling Complexity in Learning Environments: Theory and Research, (2006); Doersch C., Tutorial on Variational Autoencoders, (2016); Koedinger K.R., Corbett A.T., Perfetti C., The knowledge-learning-instruction framework: Bridging the science-practice chasm to enhance robust student learning, Cognitive Science, 36, 5, pp. 757-798, (2012); Kramer M.A., Nonlinear principal component analysis using autoassociative neural networks, AIChE Journal, 37, 2, pp. 233-243, (1991); Lee D.D., Sebastian Seung H., Algorithms for non-negative matrix factorization, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems., pp. 556-562, (2001); Lim K.-L., Jiang X., Yi C., Deep clustering with variational autoencoder, Ieee Signal Processing Letters, 27, pp. 231-235, (2020); Lin X., Boutros P.C., Optimization and expansion of non-negative matrix factorization, Bmc Bioinformatics, 21, 1, pp. 1-10, (2020); Matsuda N., Furukawa T., Bier N., Faloutsos C., Machine beats experts: Automatic discovery of skill models for data-driven online course refinement, International Educational Data Mining Society, (2015); Schraagen J.M., Chipman S.F., Shalin V.L., Cognitive Task Analysis, (2000); Zhang L., Chen Z., Zheng M., He X., Robust non-negative matrix factorization, Frontiers of Electrical and Electronic Engineering in China, 6, 2, pp. 192-200, (2011)",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,"8th Annual ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2021",22 June 2021 through 25 June 2021,"Virtual, Online",169423.0,,978-145038215-1,,,English,LS - Proc.

Analyzing Patterns in Student SQL Solutions via Levenshtein Edit Distance,2021,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"Structured Query Language (SQL), the standard language for relational database management systems, is an essential skill for software developers, data scientists, and professionals who need to interact with databases. SQL is highly structured and presents diverse ways for learners to acquire this skill. However, despite the significance of SQL to other related fields, little research has been done to understand how students learn SQL as they work on homework assignments. In this paper, we analyze students' SQL submissions to homework problems of the Database Systems course offered at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. For each student, we compute the Levenshtein Edit Distances between every submission and their final submission to understand how students reached their final solution and how they overcame any obstacles in their learning process. Our system visualizes the edit distances between students' submissions to a SQL problem, enabling instructors to identify interesting learning patterns and approaches. These findings will help instructors target their instruction in difficult SQL areas for the future and help students learn SQL more effectively. © 2021 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,Analyzing Patterns in Student SQL Solutions via Levenshtein Edit Distance,Yang S.; Wei Z.; Herman G.L.; Alawini A.,"Yang, Sophia (57224636268); Wei, Ziyuan (57224644304); Herman, Geoffrey L.

Analyzing Student Reflection Sentiments and Problem-Solving Procedures in MOOCs,2021,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"Student reflection is thought to be an important part of retaining and understanding knowledge gained in a course. Using natural language processing, we analyze and interpret student reflections from Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) to understand the students' sentiments and problem-solving procedures. The reflections are free text responses to questions from MIT 6.00.1x, an introductory programming MOOC. We compare different sentiment analysis methods, and conclude that the best-performing methods can robustly classify sentiment of student responses. In addition, we develop methods to analyze student problem-solving procedures using sentence parsing and topic modeling. We find our method can distinguish some common problem-solving procedures such as utilizing course resources. © 2021 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,Analyzing Student Reflection Sentiments and Problem-Solving Procedures in MOOCs,Shashkov A.; Gold R.; Hemberg E.; Kong B.; Bell A.; O'Reilly U.-M.,"Shashkov, Alexander (57224637227); Gold, Robert (57219713454); Hemberg, Erik (19638760600); Kong, ByeongJo (57224626651); Bell, Ana (57215551299); O'Reilly, Una-May (6602579515)",57224637227; 57219713454; 19638760600; 57224626651; 57215551299; 6602579515,Analyzing Student Reflection Sentiments and Problem-Solving Procedures in MOOCs,2021.0,L@S 2021 - Proceedings of the 8th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,247,250,3.0,2.0,10.1145/3430895.3460150,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108117913&doi=10.1145%2f3430895.3460150&partnerID=40&md5=c8b4de008165d77f62912c82d69fddf6,"Williams College, Williamstown, MA, United States; Oberlin College, Oberlin, OH, United States; Alfa, Mit Csail, Cambridge, MA, United States","Shashkov A., Williams College, Williamstown, MA, United States; Gold R., Oberlin College, Oberlin, OH, United States; Hemberg E., Alfa, Mit Csail, Cambridge, MA, United States; Kong B., Alfa, Mit Csail, Cambridge, MA, United States; Bell A., Alfa, Mit Csail, Cambridge, MA, United States; O'Reilly U.-M., Alfa, Mit Csail, Cambridge, MA, United States",MOOCs; natural language processing; reflective learning; sentence parsing; sentiment analysis; topic modeling,Distance education; Sentiment analysis; Syntactics; Free texts; Introductory programming; Massive open online course; NAtural language processing; Problem-solving procedures; Sentence parsing; Student response; Topic Modeling; Students,,,,,,,"Bell A., Kelton J., McDonagh N., Mladenovic R., Morrison K., A critical evaluation of the usefulness of a coding scheme to categorise levels of reflective thinking, Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education, 36, 12, pp. 797-815, (2011); Bird S., Klein E., Loper E., Natural Language Processing with Python (1st Ed, (2009); Boud D., Keogh R., Walker D., Reflection: Turning Experience into Learning, (1985); Chen Y., Yu B., Zhang X., Yu Y., Topic modeling for evaluating students' reflective writing: A case study of pre-service teachers' journals, Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Learning Analytics & Knowledge (LAK '16), pp. 1-5, (2016); Edalati M., The Potential of Machine Learning and Nlp for Handling Students' Feedback (A Short Survey), (2020); Fasihuddin H., Skinner G., Athauda R., Boosting the opportunities of open learning (moocs) through learning theories, Gstf Journal on Computing (JoC), 3, 12, (2014); Garbe W., SymSpell: 1 Million Times Faster through Symmetric Delete Spelling Correction Algorithm, (2019); MOOC-Learner-Reflection-Analytics, (2021); Hu M., Liu B., Mining and summarizing customer reviews, Kdd ', 4, (2004); Hutto C.J., Gilbert E., Vader: A parsimonious rule-based model for sentiment analysis of social media text, Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Weblogs and Social Media, Icwsm 2014 (01 2015), (2015); Kiros R., Zhu Y., Salakhutdinov R., Zemel R.S., Torralba A., Urtasun R., Fidler S., Skip-thought vectors, CoRR, (2015); Manning C.D., Surdeanu M., Bauer J., Finkel J., Bethard S.J., McClosky D., The stanford corenlp natural language processing toolkit, Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) System Demonstrations., pp. 55-60, (2014); Ozgur A., Ozgur L., Gungor T., Text Categorization with Class-Based and Corpus-Based Keyword Selection., pp. 606-615, (2005); Roder M., Both A., Hinneburg A., Exploring the space of topic coherence measures, Proceedings of the Eighth Acm International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining (WSDM '15), pp. 399-408, (2015); Vytasek J.M., Wise A.F., Woloshen S., Topic models to support instructors in mooc forums, Proceedings of the Seventh International Learning Analytics & Knowledge Conference (LAK '17), pp. 610-611, (2017); Yin J., Wang J., A dirichlet multinomial mixture model-based approach for short text clustering, Proceedings of the Acm Sigkdd International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 8, (2014)",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,"8th Annual ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2021",22 June 2021 through 25 June 2021,"Virtual, Online",169423.0,,978-145038215-1,,,English,LS - Proc.

Applying the Behavior Change Technique Taxonomy from Public Health Interventions to Educational Research,2021,Full Paper,L@Scale 5: Perspectives from US East Coast,"Public health research has developed a deep understanding of ways to help people live healthier lives through scalable interventions that change their behaviors. This work offers valuable insights for supporting learners in educational contexts, especially for improving self-regulation and goal-directed behaviors like completing a course of study-a persistent issue in formal and information post-secondary education. We present the widely adopted Behavior Change Technique (BCT) taxonomy as a model for systematically cataloging interventions in education and as a resource for inspiring new interventions in education based on public health evidence. Approaching the issue of learner attrition from the BCT perspective, we show how recent educational interventions fit into the BCT taxonomy and how the taxonomy can be used to develop new evidence-based intervention approaches. Borrowing insights from decades of public health research can advance parallel efforts in education to help learners at scale to stay on track and reach their academic goals. © 2021 ACM.",,,,,,100,Applying the Behavior Change Technique Taxonomy from Public Health Interventions to Educational Research,Cho J.Y.; Kizilcec R.F.,"Cho, Ji Yong (57202043077); Kizilcec, René F.

Assessing Function Names and Quantifying the Relationship Between Identifiers and Their Functionality to Improve Them,2021,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"When students first learn to program, they often focus on functionality: does a program work? In an era where software volume and complexity increase exponentially, it is equally important that they learn to write code with style. Quality code starts with the building blocks for any program, its functions. A carefully chosen name is vital for program maintainability and manageability. The identifier is the most portable and concise way to summarize what the function does. What makes for the right choice? And can we automatically assess the quality of function names? Using natural language processing, we were able to create a probabilistic model to evaluate their clarity. Using functionality encodings, we attempt to learn the relationship between functions in different programs to improve their names.

Automating the Assessment of Problem-solving Practices Using Log Data and Data Mining Techniques,2021,Full Paper,L@Scale 2: Perspectives from US West Coast,"Interactive simulations provide an exciting opportunity to assess and teach students the practices used by scientists and engineers to solve real-world problems. This study examines how the logged interaction data from a simulation-based task could be used to automate the assessment of complex problem-solving practices. A total of 73 college students worked on an interactive circuit puzzle embedded in a science simulation in an interview setting. Their problem-solving processes were videotaped and logged in the backend of the simulation. We extracted different sets of features from the log data and evaluated their effectiveness as predictors of students' problem-solving success and evidence for specific problem-solving practices. Our results indicate that the application of data mining techniques guided by knowledge gained from qualitative observation was instrumental in the discovery of semantically meaningful features from the raw log data. These knowledge-grounded features were significant predictors of students' overall problem-solving success and provided evidence on how well they adopted specific problem-solving practices, including decomposition, data collection, and data recording. The results point to promising directions for how scaffolding/feedback could be provided in educational simulations to enhance student learning in problem-solving skills. © 2021 ACM.",,,,,,100,Automating the Assessment of Problem-solving Practices Using Log Data and Data Mining Techniques,Wang K.D.; Salehi S.; Arseneault M.; Nair K.; Wieman C.,"Wang, Karen D.

Blending Peer Instruction with Just-In-Time Teaching: Jointly Optimal Task Scheduling with Feedback for Classroom Flipping,2021,Full Paper,L@Scale 3: Perspectives from Oceania,"Blended learning often requires alternating between asynchronous pre-class and synchronous in-class activities using online technologies to enhance the overall learning experience. Subject to constraints on desired learning outcome specifications and individual student preference, can we jointly optimize pre-class and in-class tasks to improve the two-way interaction between students and the instructor? We leverage ideas of self-assessment in Just-In-Time Teaching and Peer Instruction to propose an optimization-theoretic framework to analyze the optimal trade-off between the time invested in two different learning tasks for each individual student. We show that the problem can be formulated as a linear program, which can be efficiently solved to determine the optimal amount of time for pre-class and in-class learning. We develop a mobile chatbot software integrated with feedback data analytics to blend asynchronous pre-class quiz assessment together with the synchronous in-class poll-quiz routine of Peer Instruction to achieve classroom flipping that can be used for remote and hybrid teaching and learning. © 2021 ACM.",,,,,,100,Blending Peer Instruction with Just-In-Time Teaching: Jointly Optimal Task Scheduling with Feedback for Classroom Flipping,Li J.;

Can Feedback based on Predictive Data Improve Learners' Passing Rates in MOOCs? A Preliminary Analysis,2021,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"This work in progress paper investigates if timely feedback increases learners' passing rate in a MOOC. An experiment conducted with 2,421 learners in the Coursera platform tests if weekly messages sent to groups of learners with the same probability of dropping out the course can improve retention. These messages can contain information about: (1) the average time spent in the course, or (2) the average time per learning session, or (3) the exercises performed, or (4) the video-lectures completed. Preliminary results show that the completion rate increased 12% with the intervention compared with data from 1,445 learners that participated in the same course in a previous session without the intervention. We discuss the limitations of these preliminary results and the future research derived from them. © 2021 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,Can Feedback based on Predictive Data Improve Learners' Passing Rates in MOOCs?

Characterizing Amateur Tutoring Behavior on a Large Online Learning Platform,2021,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"Online tutoring is an increasingly popular learning and business model, which matches students with amateur tutors recruited through a platform. While such platforms offer a unique opportunity to study how online and on-demand learning happens at scale, little is still known about how tutors engage on the platform. We present an exploratory analysis of tutor engagement on a large online tutoring platform, using an anonymized dataset of virtual sessions between tutors and students. Specifically, we show significant association between tutor engagement and associated factors like the subject and difficulty level of questions, and the experience of tutors on the platform. Moreover, we highlight important heterogeneities in tutor behavior, particularly in their work intensity. Our findings hold important implications for tutor retention and learning effectiveness on such platforms. © 2021 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,Characterizing Amateur Tutoring Behavior on a Large Online Learning Platform,Shan D.; Bhattacharya P.; Kao B.; Phan T.,"Shan, Dapeng (57224630747); Bhattacharya, Prasanta (55803604700); Kao, Ben (35221592600); Phan, Tuan (57213257502)",57224630747; 55803604700; 35221592600; 57213257502,Characterizing Amateur Tutoring Behavior on a Large Online Learning Platform,2021.0,L@S 2021 - Proceedings of the 8th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,239,242,3.0,0.0,10.1145/3430895.3460148,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108060492&doi=10.1145%2f3430895.3460148&partnerID=40&md5=3475f23031129c244202d6647af58258,"The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong; Institute of High Performance Computing (IHPC), A*STAR, Singapore, Singapore","Shan D., The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong; Bhattacharya P., Institute of High Performance Computing (IHPC), A*STAR, Singapore, Singapore; Kao B., The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong; Phan T., The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong",amateur tutoring; dialogic teaching; online learning,Large dataset; Business modeling; Exploratory analysis; Learning effectiveness; On demand learning; Online learning; Online tutoring; E-learning,,,,,,,"Alexander R., Dialogic Teaching Essentials, pp. 1-7, (2010); Alexander R., A Dialogic Teaching Companion, (2020); Axelson R.D., Flick A., Defining student engagement, Change: The Magazine of Higher Learning, 43, 1, pp. 38-43, (2010); Chappell S., Arnold P., Nunnery J., Grant M., An examination of an online tutoring program's impact on low-Achieving middle school students' mathematics achievement, Online Learning, 19, 5, pp. 37-53, (2015); Chen G., Ferreira R., Lang D., Gasevic D., Predictors of student satisfaction: A large-scale study of human-human online tutorial dialogues, International Educational Data Mining Society, (2019); Chi M.T.H., Siler S.A., Jeong H., Yamauchi T., Hausmann R.G., Learning from human tutoring, Cognitive Science, 25, 4, pp. 471-533, (2001); Dhawan S., Online learning: A panacea in the time of covid-19 crisis, Journal of Educational Technology Systems, 49, 1, pp. 5-22, (2020); Dillon C., Greene B., Learner differences in distance learning: Finding differences that matter, Handbook of Distance Education, pp. 235-244, (2003); Goetz T., Ludtke O., Nett U.E., Keller M.M., Lipnevich A.A., Characteristics of teaching and students' emotions in the classroom: Investigating differences across domains, Contemporary Educational Psychology, 38, 4, pp. 383-394, (2013); Graesser A.C., Person N.K., Magliano J.P., Collaborative dialogue patterns in naturalistic one-to-one tutoring, Applied Cognitive Psychology, 9, 6, pp. 495-522, (1995); Khalil H., Ebner M., Moocs completion rates and possible methods to improve retention-A literature review, EdMedia+ Innovate Learning, pp. 1305-1313, (2014); Larreamendy-Joerns J., Leinhardt G., Going the distance with online education, Review of Educational Research, 76, 4, pp. 567-605, (2006); Yen C., Loh R., Teo T.C., Understanding asian students learning styles, cultural influence and learning strategies, Journal of Education & Social Policy, 7, 1, pp. 194-210, (2017); MacDonald J., Blended Learning and Online Tutoring: Planning Learner Support and Activity Design, (2008); McGuigan A., Golden L., Rules of engagement: Developing the online tutor, Research in Learning Technology, 20, (2012); Price L., Richardson J.T.E., Jelfs A., Face-to-face versus online tutoring support in distance education, Studies in Higher Education, 32, 1, pp. 1-20, (2007); Resnick L.B., Schantz F., Talking to learn: The promise and challenge of dialogic teaching, Socializing Intelligence through Academic Talk and Dialogue, pp. 441-450, (2015); Salmon G., E-moderating: The Key to Teaching and Learning Online, (2003); Swan K., Learning effectiveness online: What the research tells us, Elements of Quality Online Education, Practice and Direction, 4, 1, pp. 13-47, (2003)",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,"8th Annual ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2021",22 June 2021 through 25 June 2021,"Virtual, Online",169423.0,,978-145038215-1,,,English,LS - Proc.

Classification of Discussions in MOOC Forums: An Incremental Modeling Approach,2021,Full Paper,L@Scale 4: Perspectives from Europe and US,"Supervised classification models are commonly used for classifying discussions in a MOOC forum. In most cases these models require a tedious process for manual labeling the forum messages as training data. So, new methods are needed to reduce the human effort necessary for the preparation of such training datasets. In this study we follow an incremental approach in order to examine how soon after the beginning of a new course, we have collected enough data for training a supervised classification model. We show that by employing features that derive from a seeded topic modeling method, we achieve classifiers with reliable performance early enough in the course life, thus reducing significantly the human effort. The content of the MOOC platform is used to bias the topic extraction towards discussions related to (a) course content, (b) logistics, or (c) social interactions. Then, we develop a supervised model at the start of each week based on the topic features of all previous weeks and evaluate its performance in classifying the discussions for the rest of the course. Our approach was implemented in three different MOOCs of different subjects and different sizes. The findings reveal that supervised models are able to perform reliably quite early in a MOOC's life and retain a steady overall accuracy across the remaining weeks, without requiring to be trained with the entire forum dataset. © 2021 ACM.",,,,,,100,Classification of Discussions in MOOC Forums: An Incremental Modeling Approach,Ntourmas A.; Dimitriadis Y.; Daskalaki S.; Avouris N.,"Ntourmas, Anastasios (57205630327); Dimitriadis, Yannis (6603770066); Daskalaki, Sophia (6603261746); Avouris, Nikolaos (6603741790)",57205630327; 6603770066; 6603261746; 6603741790,Classification of Discussions in MOOC Forums: An Incremental Modeling Approach,2021.0,L@S 2021 - Proceedings of the 8th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,183,194,11.0,4.0,10.1145/3430895.3460137,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108098709&doi=10.1145%2f3430895.3460137&partnerID=40&md5=721ebb788c9ac9b0f8d4776baaefa291,"University of Patras, Patras, Greece; Universidad de Valladolid, Valladolid, Spain","Ntourmas A., University of Patras, Patras, Greece; Dimitriadis Y., Universidad de Valladolid, Valladolid, Spain; Daskalaki S., University of Patras, Patras, Greece; Avouris N., University of Patras, Patras, Greece",corex; discussion forum; MOOC; supervised classification; topic modeling,Supervised learning; Incremental approach; Incremental modeling; Overall accuracies; Reliable performance; Social interactions; Supervised classification; Topic extraction; Training data sets; Curricula,,,,,"European Commission, EC, (588438-EPP-1-2017-1-EL-EPPKA2-KA); Agencia Estatal de Investigación, AEI, (TIN2014-53199-C3-2-R, TIN2017-85179-C3-2-R); Junta de Castilla y León, (VA257P18)","This research is performed in the frame of collaboration of the University of Patras with online platform mathesis.cup.gr.

Combining Collaborative Reflection based on Worked-Out Examples with Problem-Solving Practice: Designing Collaborative Programming Projects for Learning at Scale,2021,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"Computer science pedagogy has overwhelmingly favored problem-solving practice over methods of engagement like worked-out example study especially in advanced classes. This is due to the belief that while these alternative methods may improve student conceptual learning, they may leave them less able to perform on authentic problem-solving tasks from a lack of hands-on practice. In this paper, we perform a direct comparison of this trade-off in a synchronous collaborative programming project by adjusting the boundary between problem-solving and collaborative reflection based on a worked-out example while keeping the total time on task constant. We find that the more time students spent on worked example study, the more was the observed improvement in the pre-to post-test scores with no significant difference in performance on a subsequent problem-solving task. These results, therefore, challenge the dominant place of problem-solving practice in the advanced curricular context and inform the design of collaborative programming projects at scale. © 2021 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,Combining Collaborative Reflection based on Worked-Out Examples with Problem-Solving Practice: Designing Collaborative Programming Projects for Learning at Scale,Sankaranarayanan S.; Kandimalla S.R.; Bogart C.; Charles Murray R.; Hilton M.; Sakr M.; Rosé C.,"Sankaranarayanan, Sreecharan (57200651663); Kandimalla, Siddharth Reddy (57217302886); Bogart, Christopher (25649133400); Charles Murray, R.

Comparative Analysis of the Feature Extraction Approaches for Predicting Learners Progress in Online Courses: MicroMasters Credential versus Traditional MOOCs,2021,Full Paper,L@Scale 4: Perspectives from Europe and US,"Although MicroMasters courses differ from traditional undergraduate level MOOCs in student demographics, course design, and outcomes, the various aspects of this type of program have not yet been sufficiently investigated. This study aims to pave the path towards enhancing the design of constituent courses of MicroMasters programs with the focus on the application of Machine Learning algorithms. Thereby, we use a large-scale clickstream edX database to explore the trends in the online engagement of learners in a MicroMasters program, detect clickstream events that are highly correlated with the students' progress, and investigate how the engagements differ from those in a classic individual MOOC. Contrary to the previous application of machine learning algorithms in learning analytics, we implement various well-known machine learning approaches such as stepwise regression and tree-based algorithms, evaluate their performance, and propose the best-performed approach.

Components of Assessments and Grading At Scale,2021,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"One of the major criticisms of efforts towards offering education at scale has been the Trap of Routine Assessment, the risk that student assessment will suffer from becoming excessively simplified in service of automation and scale. In this research, we examine the ways that students in an at-scale graduate program in computer science were assessed during their degrees. The program in question has scaled to over 10,000 students in only a few years, but awards a traditional Master's degree, providing the opportunity to investigate whether scale was achieved by transitioning to more routine assessment or by bringing scale to traditional strategies. To do this, we investigate the syllabi of 52 classes offered through the program to identify the types of assessments used, and we survey teaching teams for their approaches to evaluating these assessments. We merge this data with historical enrollment data to gain an overall summary of the kinds of assessments and evaluations received during their degrees. We ultimately find the program's scale has been managed by scaling up traditional assessment and evaluation strategies as the majority of grades are generated by human teaching teams based on projects and homeworks, with a relatively smaller portion generated exclusively by automated evaluation of exams. © 2021 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,Components of Assessments and Grading at Scale,Eicher B.L.; Joyner D.,"Eicher, Bobbie Lynn (57202432695); Joyner, David (35183234600)",57202432695; 35183234600,Components of Assessments and Grading at Scale,2021.0,L@S 2021 - Proceedings of the 8th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,303,306,3.0,6.0,10.1145/3430895.3460165,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108093053&doi=10.1145%2f3430895.3460165&partnerID=40&md5=c2a2b08022546f5fcafb4e4f65d5af23,"Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States","Eicher B.L., Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States; Joyner D., Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States",adult education; auto-grading; grading; online learning; peer-grading; project-based learning; scaling assessments,Grading; Risk assessment; Teaching; Automated evaluation; Evaluation strategies; Graduate program; Master's degree; Scaling-up; Student assessment; Teaching teams; Traditional assessment; Students,,,,,,,"Cotner S.H., Fall B.A., Wick S.M., Walker J.D., Baepler P.M., Rapid feedback assessment methods: Can we improve engagement and preparation for exams in large-enrollment courses?, Journal of Science Education and Technology, 17, 5, pp. 437-443, (2008); Eicher B.L., Joyner D., Toward reshaping the syllabus for education at scale, Proceedings of the Eighth Acm Conference on Learning @ Scale (L@S '21), (2021); Ericsson K.A., Krampe R.T., Tesch-Romer C., The role of deliberate practice in the acquisition of expert performance, Psychological Review, 100, 3, (1993); Kling N., McCorkle D., Miller C., Reardon J., The impact of testing frequency on student performance in a marketing course, Journal of Education for Business, 81, 2, pp. 67-72, (2005); Kulkarni C.E., Bernstein M.S., Klemmer S.R., Peerstudio: Rapid peer feedback emphasizes revision and improves performance, Proceedings of the Second (2015) Acm Conference on Learning@ Scale., pp. 75-84, (2015); Murphy D.P., Stanga K.G., The effects of frequent testing in an income tax course: An experiment, Journal of Accounting Education, 12, 1, pp. 27-41, (1994); Reich J., Failure to Disrupt: Why Technology Alone Can't Transform Education, (2020)",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,"8th Annual ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2021",22 June 2021 through 25 June 2021,"Virtual, Online",169423.0,,978-145038215-1,,,English,LS - Proc.

Content-Neutral Immersive Environments for Cultivating Scalable Camaraderie,2021,Full Paper,L@Scale 1: Perspectives from North America,"Drawbacks of online education, especially at scale, include the isolation and loss of community that come with taking classes from one's home rather than in a typical coordinated classroom. In this series of studies, we explore the potential of an immersive virtual environment to recreate shared educational contexts in an online program, emphasizing those that focus on universal dynamics like discussions, Q&A, and lecture-watching. Using Mozilla Hubs-which offers virtual reality as well as a browser-based immersive environment for participants without VR headsets-we implement three common, student-driven on-campus environments: a lecture hall, a student lounge, and a poster session. We test these environments with students in an online graduate program through surveys and a controlled experiment. We find significant interest in the potential of these environments, but hurdles to their adoption as well. © 2021 ACM.",,,,,,100,Content-Neutral Immersive Environments for Cultivating Scalable Camaraderie,Joyner D.A.; Mavilakandy A.; Mittal I.; Kutnick D.; MacIntyre B.,"Joyner, David A.

Data-informed Decision-making in TEFA Processes: An Empirical Study of a Process Derived from Peer-Instruction,2021,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"When formative assessment involves a large number of learners, Technology-Enhanced Formative Assessments are one of the most popular solutions. However, current TEFA processes lack data-informed decision-making. By analyzing a dataset gathered from a formative assessment tool, we provide evidence about how to improve decision-making in processes that ask learners to answer the same question before and after a confrontation with peers. Our results suggest that learners' understanding increases when the proportion of correct answers before the confrontation is close to 50%, or when learners consistently rate peers' rationales. Furthermore, peer ratings are more consistent when learners' confidence degrees are consistent. These results led us to design a decision-making model whose benefits will be studied in future works. © 2021 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,Data-informed Decision-making in TEFA Processes: An Empirical Study of a Process Derived from Peer-Instruction,Andriamiseza R.; Silvestre F.; Parmentier J.-F.; Broisin J.,"Andriamiseza, Rialy (57224633827); Silvestre, Franck (56414470400); Parmentier, Jean-Francois (55084377100); Broisin, Julien (16229264400)",57224633827; 56414470400; 55084377100; 16229264400,Data-informed Decision-making in TEFA Processes: An Empirical Study of a Process Derived from Peer-Instruction,2021.0,L@S 2021 - Proceedings of the 8th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,259,262,3.0,0.0,10.1145/3430895.3460153,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108119851&doi=10.1145%2f3430895.3460153&partnerID=40&md5=8861b2edff4d68f3a7adeb5827df2368,"Irit, Toulouse, France; Inp, Toulouse, France","Andriamiseza R., Irit, Toulouse, France; Silvestre F., Irit, Toulouse, France; Parmentier J.-F., Inp, Toulouse, France; Broisin J., Irit, Toulouse, France",decision-making; learning analytics; peer instruction; technology-enhanced formative assessment,Confidence degree; Decision making models; Empirical studies; Formative assessment; In-process; Informed decision; Peer instruction; Decision making,,,,,,,"Black P., Wiliam D., Assessment and classroom learning, Assessment in Education: Principles, Policy & Practice, 5, 1, pp. 7-74, (1998); Charles E.S., Lasry N., Bhatnagar S., Adams R., Lenton K., Brouillette Y., Dugdale M., Whittaker C., Jackson P., Harnessing peer instruction in-And out-of class with mydalite, Education and Training in Optics and Photonics.

While testing companies typically use DIF to identify items to remove, we explored how domain-experts such as curriculum designers could use DIF to better understand how to design instructional materials to better serve students from diverse groups. Using Code.org's online Computer Science Discoveries (CSD) curriculum, we analyzed 139,097 responses from 19,617 students to identify DIF by gender and race in assessment items (e.g. multiple choice questions). Of the 17 items, we identified six that disadvantaged students who reported as female when compared to students who reported as non-binary or male. We also identified that most (13) items disadvantaged AHNP (African/Black, Hispanic/Latinx, Native American/Alaskan Native, Pacific Islander) students compared to WA (white, Asian) students. We then conducted a workshop and interviews with seven curriculum designers and found that they interpreted item bias relative to an intersection of item features and student identity, the broader curriculum, and differing uses for assessments. We interpreted these findings in the broader context of using data on assessment bias to inform domain-experts' efforts to design more equitable learning experiences. © 2021 ACM.",,,,,,100,"Domain Experts' Interpretations of Assessment Bias in a Scaled, Online Computer Science Curriculum",Xie B.; Davidson M.J.; Franke B.; McLeod E.; Li M.; Ko A.J.,"Xie, Benjamin (57195928948); Davidson, Matt J.

Employing Peer Review to Evaluate the Quality of Student Generated Content at Scale: A Trust Propagation Approach,2021,Full Paper,L@Scale 3: Perspectives from Oceania,"Engaging students in the creation of learning resources has been demonstrated to have pedagogical benefits and lead to the creation of large repositories of learning resources which can be used to complement student learning in different ways. However, to effectively utilise a learnersourced repository of content, a selection process is needed to separate high-quality from low-quality resources as some of the resources created by students can be ineffective, inappropriate, or incorrect. A common and scalable approach to evaluating the quality of learnersourced content is to use a peer review process where students are asked to assess the quality of resources authored by their peers. However, this method poses the problem of ""truth inference""since the judgements of students as experts-in-training cannot wholly be trusted. This paper presents a graph-based approach to propagate the reliability and trust using data from peer and instructor evaluations in order to simultaneously infer the quality of the learnersourced content and the reliability and trustworthiness of users in a live setting. We use empirical data from a learnersourcing system called RiPPLE to evaluate our approach. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach can propagate reliability and utilise the limited availability of instructors in spot-checking to improve the accuracy of the model compared to baseline models and the current model used in the system. © 2021 ACM.",,,,,,100,Employing Peer Review to Evaluate the Quality of Student Generated Content at Scale: A Trust Propagation Approach,Darvishi A.; Khosravi H.; Sadiq S.,"Darvishi, Ali (57219052527); Khosravi, Hassan (27368031300); Sadiq, Shazia (7006420326)",57219052527; 27368031300; 7006420326,Employing Peer Review to Evaluate the Quality of Student Generated Content at Scale: A Trust Propagation Approach,2021.0,L@S 2021 - Proceedings of the 8th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,139,150,11.0,11.0,10.1145/3430895.3460129,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108107280&doi=10.1145%2f3430895.3460129&partnerID=40&md5=95fd0510ea3b74cb2806e7f3d76e3e86,"The University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia","Darvishi A., The University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia; Khosravi H., The University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia; Sadiq S., The University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia",consensus approaches; crowdsourcing in education; learnersourcing; learning analytics; peer review; trust propagation,Graphic methods; Reliability; Students; Current modeling; Engaging students; Instructor evaluations; Learning resource; Peer-review process; Scalable approach; Student learning; Trust propagation; Quality control,,,,,,,"Bates S.P., Galloway R.K., Riise J., Homer D., Assessing the quality of a student-generated question repository, Physical Review Special Topics-Physics Education Research, 10, 2, (2014); Boccignone G., Napoletano P., Caggiano V., Ferraro M., A multiresolution diffused expectation-maximization algorithm for medical image segmentation, Computers in Biology and Medicine, 37, 1, pp. 83-96, (2007); Bradley P.S., Fayyad U.M., Reina C.A., Clustering very large databases using em mixture models, Proceedings 15th International Conference on Pattern Recognition.

Examining the Effects of Student Participation and Performance on the Quality of Learnersourcing Multiple-Choice Questions,2021,Full Paper,L@Scale 5: Perspectives from US East Coast,"While generating multiple-choice questions has been shown to promote deep learning, students often fail to realize this benefit and do not willingly participate in this activity. Additionally, the quality of the student-generated questions may be influenced by both their level of engagement and familiarity with the learning materials. Towards better understanding how students can generate high quality questions, we designed and deployed a multiple-choice question generation activity in seven college-level online chemistry courses. From these courses, we collected data on student interactions and their contribution to the question-generation task. A total of 201 students enrolled in the courses and 57 of them elected to generate a multiple-choice question. Our results indicated that students were able to contribute quality questions, with 67% of them being evaluated by experts as acceptable for use. We further identified several student behaviors in the online courses that are correlated to their participation in the task and the quality of their contribution. Our findings can help teachers and students better understand the benefits of student-generated questions and effectively implement future learnersourcing activities. © 2021 ACM.",,,,,,100,Examining the Effects of Student Participation and Performance on the Quality of Learnersourcing Multiple-Choice Questions,Moore S.; Nguyen H.A.; Stamper J.,"Moore, Steven (57145946000); Nguyen, Huy Anh (57212566440); Stamper, John (15758786800)",57145946000; 57212566440; 15758786800,Examining the Effects of Student Participation and Performance on the Quality of Learnersourcing Multiple-Choice Questions,2021.0,L@S 2021 - Proceedings of the 8th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,209,220,11.0,14.0,10.1145/3430895.3460140,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108088309&doi=10.1145%2f3430895.3460140&partnerID=40&md5=d45f7e65570a0778f30b3762ef26c32c,"Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, United States","Moore S., Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, United States; Nguyen H.A., Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, United States; Stamper J., Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, United States",learnersourcing; multiple-choice questions; online education; question generation; student participation,Deep learning; E-learning; High quality; Learning materials; Multiple choice questions; Online course; Student behavior; Student generated questions; Student interactions; Student participation; Students,,,,,"Institute of Education Sciences, IES, (R305B150008)",The research reported here was supported in part by a training grant from the Institute of Education Sciences (R305B150008).

Exploring Additional Personalized Support While Attempting Exercise Problems in Online Learning Platforms,2021,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"In online asynchronous learning environments, students are assigned exercises, but it is not clear how to incorporate the kinds of actions an in-person tutor might take such as explaining, providing more practice, prompting for reflection, and motivating. We explore approaches to adding ""Drop-Downs""that appear after a student submits an answer and that contain additional information to support learning. We conducted randomized A/B experiments exploring the impact of these Drop-Downs on student learning in the online portion of a flipped CS1 course. The deployed Drop-Downs in this course provided explanations, reflective prompts, additional problems, and motivational messages. The results suggest that students benefit from various Drop-Downs in different contexts, indicating the possibility of personalizing content based on the student's state. We discuss the resulting design implications of Drop-Downs in online learning systems. © 2021 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,Exploring Additional Personalized Support while Attempting Exercise Problems in Online Learning Platforms,Asano Y.; Dutta M.; Thakur T.; Solyst J.; Cristea S.; Jovic H.; Petersen A.; Williams J.J.,"Asano, Yuya (57215928789); Dutta, Madhurima (57224850834); Thakur, Trisha (57222587475); Solyst, Jaemarie (57211212328); Cristea, Stephanie (57224636542); Jovic, Helena (57224642041); Petersen, Andrew (15127790100); Williams, Joseph Jay (56159570600)",57215928789; 57224850834; 57222587475; 57211212328; 57224636542; 57224642041; 15127790100; 56159570600,Exploring Additional Personalized Support while Attempting Exercise Problems in Online Learning Platforms,2021.0,L@S 2021 - Proceedings of the 8th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,235,238,3.0,4.0,10.1145/3430895.3460145,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108064575&doi=10.1145%2f3430895.3460145&partnerID=40&md5=091a6e5bc0d9dbe602dd76440226781b,"University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, United States; University of Toronto Mississauga, Mississauga, ON, Canada","Asano Y., University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; Dutta M., University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; Thakur T., University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; Solyst J., Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, United States; Cristea S., University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; Jovic H., University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; Petersen A., University of Toronto Mississauga, Mississauga, ON, Canada; Williams J.J., University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada",A/B testing; field deployment; intervention; online learning; personalization; randomized experiments,Computer aided instruction; Drops; Learning systems; Online systems; Students; Asynchronous learning; Content-based; Design implications; On-line learning systems; Online learning; Student learning; Support learning; E-learning,,,,,"Office of Naval Research, ONR, (00014-18-1-2755); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC, (-2019-06968)",We would like to thank instructors of the CS1 course and Sam Maldonado for helping us to deploy our interventions and the CS1 students who consented to have their data analyzed for this study.

Exploring Design Choices in Data-driven Hints for Python Programming Homework,2021,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"Students often struggle during programming homework and may need help getting started or localizing errors. One promising and scalable solution is to provide automated programming hints, generated from prior student data, which suggest how a student can edit their code to get closer to a solution, but little work has explored how to design these hints for large-scale, real-world classroom settings, or evaluated such designs. In this paper, we present CodeChecker, a system which generates hints automatically using student data, and incorporates them into an existing CS1 online homework environment, used by over 1000 students per semester.

Forecasting Undergraduate Majors Using Academic Transcript Data,2021,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"Committing to a major is a fateful step in an undergraduate's education, yet the relationship between courses taken early in an academic career and ultimate major choice remains little studied at scale. We analyze transcript data capturing the academic careers of 26,892 undergraduates at a private university between 2000 and 2020. We forecast students' terminal major on the basis of course-choice sequences beginning at university entry. We represent course enrollment history using natural-language methods and vector embeddings. We find that a student's very first enrolled course predicts their terminal major thirty times better than random guessing and more than a third better than majority class voting. © 2021 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,Forecasting Undergraduate Majors Using Academic Transcript Data,Lang D.; Wang A.; Dalal N.; Paepcke A.; Stevens M.,"Lang, David (57207730522); Wang, Alex (57224644447); Dalal, Nathan (57224637597); Paepcke, Andreas (7003930993); Stevens, Mitchell (24823440500)",57207730522; 57224644447; 57224637597; 7003930993; 24823440500,Forecasting Undergraduate Majors Using Academic Transcript Data,2021.0,L@S 2021 - Proceedings of the 8th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,243,246,3.0,1.0,10.1145/3430895.3460149,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108063923&doi=10.1145%2f3430895.3460149&partnerID=40&md5=ddeeabafda09a3164fd94cebddde4be4,"Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States","Lang D., Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States; Wang A., Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States; Dalal N., Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States; Paepcke A., Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States; Stevens M., Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States",academic sequencing; course embeddings; degree prediction; higher education; machine learning; NLP,Academic careers; Choice sequence; Data capturing; Natural languages; University entries,,,,,,,"Aulck L., Aras R., Li L., L'Heureux C., Lu P., West J., STEM-ming the Tide: Predicting Stem Attrition Using Student Transcript Data, (2017); Binder A.J., Davis D.B., Bloom N., Career funneling: How elite students learn to define and desire prestigious"" jobs, Sociology of Education, 89, 1, pp. 20-39, (2016); Caselles-Dupre H., Lesaint F., Royo-Letelier J., 2vec applied to recommendation: Hyperparameters matter, Proceedings of the 12th Acm Conference on Recommender Systems., pp. 352-356, (2018); Chambliss D.F., Takacs C.G., How College Works: Cambridge, (2014); Chen Y., Johri A., Rangwala H., Running out of stem: A comparative study across stem majors of college students at-risk of dropping out early, Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Learning Analytics and Knowledge., pp. 270-279, (2018); Gottfried M., Bozick R., Supporting the stem pipeline: Linking applied stem course-taking in high school to declaring a stem major in college, Education Finance and Policy, 11, 2, pp. 177-202, (2016); Jiang W., Pardos Z.A., Evaluating sources of course information and models of representation on a variety of institutional prediction tasks, International Educational Data Mining Society, (2020); Page L.C., Scott-Clayton J., Improving college access in the united states: Barriers and policy responses, Economics of Education Review, 51, pp. 4-22, (2016); Pardos Z.A., Fan Z., Jiang W., Connectionist recommendation in the wild: On the utility and scrutability of neural networks for personalized course guidance, User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction, 29, 2, pp. 487-525, (2019); Pardos Z.A., Nam A.J.H., A university map of course knowledge, PloS One, 15, 9, (2020); Rehrek R., Sojka P., Gensim-statistical Semantics in Python, (2011); Pedro M.O.S., Ocumpaugh J., Baker R.S., Heffernan N.T., Predicting stem and non-stem college major enrollment from middle school interaction with mathematics educational software, EDM., pp. 276-279, (2014); Weeden K.A., Gelbgiser D., Morgan S.L., Pipeline dreams: Occupational plans and gender differences in stem major persistence and completion, Sociology of Education, 93, 4, pp. 297-314, (2020)",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,"8th Annual ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2021",22 June 2021 through 25 June 2021,"Virtual, Online",169423.0,,978-145038215-1,,,English,LS - Proc.

Generating Response-Specific Elaborated Feedback Using Long-Form Neural Question Answering,2021,Full Paper,L@Scale 1: Perspectives from North America,"In contrast to simple feedback, which provides students with the correct answer, elaborated feedback provides an explanation of the correct answer with respect to the student's error. Elaborated feedback is thus a challenge for AI in education systems because it requires dynamic explanations, which traditionally require logical reasoning and knowledge engineering to generate. This study presents an alternative approach that formulates elaborated feedback in terms of long-form question answering (LFQA). An off-the-shelf LFQA system was evaluated by human raters in a 2x2x2x2 ablation design that manipulated the context documents given to the LFQA model and the post-processing of model output. Results indicate that context manipulations improve performance but that post-processing can have detrimental results. © 2021 ACM.",,,,,,100,Generating Response-Specific Elaborated Feedback Using Long-Form Neural Question Answering,Olney A.M.,"Olney, Andrew M.

Impact of Contextual Tips for Auto-Gradable Programming Exercises in MOOCs,2021,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"Learners in Massive Open Online Courses offering practical programming exercises face additional challenges next to the actual course content. Beginners have to find approaches to deal with misconceptions and often struggle with the correct syntax while solving the exercises. The paper at hand presents insights from offering contextual tips in a web-based development environment used for practical programming exercises. We measured the effects of our approach in a Python course with 6,000 active students in a hidden A/B test and additionally used qualitative surveys.

Introducing Data Wrangling using Graphical Subgoals - Findings from an e-Learning Study,2021,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"Students across disciplines are increasingly wrangling their data programmatically. Previous research indicates that graphical, instructor-provided subgoals could help novices solve data wrangling tasks, and that graphical thumbnails could make the syntax documentation more usable. Using a 2x2 design, we trialled different versions of a web application for teaching data wrangling, which contains both programmatic and non-programmatic exercises. Half of all participants received graphical subgoals to visualise data wrangling solutions instead of just textual subgoals, and half received graphical thumbnails. Performance and time on task are reported, but did not result in any significant effect.

Knowledge Sharing in Tension: Interacting and Documenting on Stack Overflow,2021,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"This exploratory paper examines a tension between interacting and documenting as knowledge sharing tasks on Stack Overflow, a platform that supports informal learning at scale in the domain of programming. The study works with platform data in the form of the text of posts and accompanying metadata along with 16 interviews with users. Drawing on trace ethnography as an approach to maintaining an interpretive stance while combining several types of data, this preliminary analysis discusses two interrelated particularities of the tension. The discussion of these particularities, platform mechanics and competing temporalities, helps to unpack a tension that is both a phenomenon of analytic interest and a member's concern for users of the platform. © 2021 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,Knowledge Sharing in Tension: Interacting and Documenting on Stack Overflow,Hillman T.; Seredko A.; Nivala M.; Osborne T.,"Hillman, Thomas (49963451900); Seredko, Alena (57218096461); Nivala, Markus (26633108900); Osborne, Tanya (57205264859)",49963451900; 57218096461; 26633108900; 57205264859,Knowledge Sharing in Tension: Interacting and Documenting on Stack Overflow,2021.0,L@S 2021 - Proceedings of the 8th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,331,334,3.0,1.0,10.1145/3430895.3460981,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108107162&doi=10.1145%2f3430895.3460981&partnerID=40&md5=9d1b6ae395e16d8fe01bc4492515a05e,"University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden","Hillman T., University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden; Seredko A., University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden; Nivala M., University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden; Osborne T., University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden",community question answering; informal learning; knowledge sharing,Informal learning; Knowledge-sharing; Preliminary analysis; Stack overflow; Knowledge management,,,,,"Vetenskapsrådet, VR, (2018-03682)",This research is supported by Swedish Research Council grant 2018-03682.,"Garfinkel H., Studies in Ethnomethodology, (1967); Geiger R.S., Ribes D., Trace ethnography: Following coordination through documentary practices, 2011 44th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences Kauai, Hi, pp. 1-10, (2011); Hudgins W., Et al., Informal learning communities: The other massive open online c., Proceedings of the Seventh Acm Conference on Learning @ Scale, pp. 91-101, (2020); Kumar V., Pedanekar N.E., Mining shapes of expertise in online social q&a communities, Proceedings of the 19th Acm Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing Companion-CSCW '16 Companion, pp. 317-320, (2016); Mamykina L., Et al., Design lessons from the fastest q&a site in the west, Proceedings of the 2011 Annual Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems-CHI '11, (2011); Mugar G., Et al., Planet hunters and seafloor explorers: Legitimate peripheral participation through practice proxies in online citizen science, Proceedings of the 17th Acm Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work & Social Computing, pp. 109-119, (2014); Pai A.H., Et al., Modeling programming knowledge for mentoring at scale, Proceedings of the First Acm Conference on Learning @ Scale Conference, pp. 181-182, (2014); Srnicek N., Platform Capitalism, (2016); What Is Reputation?

"Learning Analytics Dashboard Research Has Neglected Diversity, Equity and Inclusion",2021,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"Learning analytic dashboards (LADs) have become more prevalent in higher education to help students, faculty, and staff make data-informed decisions. Despite extensive research on the design and usability of LADs, few studies have examined them in relation to issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion. We conducted a critical literature review to address three research questions: How does LAD research contribute to improving diversity, equity, and inclusion? How might LADs contribute to maintaining or exacerbating inequitable outcomes? And what future opportunities exist in this research space? Our review showed little use of LADs to address or improve issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion in the literature thus far. We argue that excluding these issues from LAD research is not an isolated oversight and it risks reinforcing existing inequities within the higher education system. We argue that LADs can be designed, researched, and deployed intentionally to advance equitable outcomes and help dismantle inequities in education. We highlight opportunities for future LAD research to address issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion. © 2021 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,"Learning Analytics Dashboard Research Has Neglected Diversity, Equity and Inclusion",Williamson K.; Kizilcec R.F.,"Williamson, Kimberly (57224642578); Kizilcec, René F.

Modeling Temporal Association of Cognition-Topic in MOOC Discussion to Track Learners' Cognitive Engagement Dynamics,2021,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"In the discussion forums of massive open online courses (MOOCs), cognitive processing (e.g., insight, certain) is considered an essential factor that can affect learners' learning outcomes, but the relationship between them has not been thoroughly investigated. Especially the dynamic nature of cognitive processing is still a significant research gap. In this study, we proposed an unsupervised topic model named Temporal Cognitive Topic Model (TCTM) to automatically classify cognitive processes and obtain the conditional probability with topics over time. The results indicated that completers had more active and timely cognitive engagement as time went on and tended to use certain cognitive words to discuss the topics related to the examination and certificates, which showed that they had explicit learning goals and plans. Non-completers often used exclusive cognitive words to discuss some off-task content that pointed out a distractive learning process. Using the model, teachers can capture learners' dynamic cognitive states and associated topics to improve teaching methods and increase course completion rates. © 2021 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,Modeling Temporal Association of Cognition-Topic in MOOC Discussion to Track Learners' Cognitive Engagement Dynamics,Liu Z.; Mu R.; Liu S.; Peng X.; Liu S.,"Liu, Zhi (56237888800); Mu, Rui (57224632815); Liu, Shiqi (57219230174); Peng, Xian (36130527600); Liu, Sannyuya (56801211900)",56237888800; 57224632815; 57219230174; 36130527600; 56801211900,Modeling Temporal Association of Cognition-Topic in MOOC Discussion to Track Learners' Cognitive Engagement Dynamics,2021.0,L@S 2021 - Proceedings of the 8th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,319,322,3.0,3.0,10.1145/3430895.3460170,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108119698&doi=10.1145%2f3430895.3460170&partnerID=40&md5=467cf8e0556b0bfa39fdee9c22218d3c,"Central China Normal University, Wuhan, China","Liu Z., Central China Normal University, Wuhan, China; Mu R., Central China Normal University, Wuhan, China; Liu S., Central China Normal University, Wuhan, China; Peng X., Central China Normal University, Wuhan, China; Liu S., Central China Normal University, Wuhan, China",cognitive processing; discussion forums; temporal cognitive topic model,Distance education; Teaching; Associated topics; Cognitive process; Cognitive processing; Conditional probabilities; Explicit learning; Learning process; Massive open online course; Temporal association; Learning systems,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61937001, 61977030, 62077017); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (30106200548, CCNU19ZN012, CCNU20TS032, CCNU21XJ034)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 62077017, 61977030, 61937001) and the Financially supported by self-determined research funds of CCNU from the colleges’ basic research and operation of MOE Fundamental Research Funds of the Central Universities (Grant Nos.

Peer-Grading at Scale with Rank Aggregation,2021,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"Thanks to the wide availability of the internet and personal computing devices, online teaching methods like Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) are becoming an essential part of modern education. While these methods enable educators to reach much more students, the massive volume of assignments to grade places a heavy burden on the instructors. Most online courses remedy this by restricting the question types to simple forms or performing naive peer-grading. These approaches are either too restricted to capture students' learning level, or require heavy supervision from the instructors to ensure the grades are fair. In this paper, we propose a rank-aggregation-based peer-grading method that estimates the quality of each assignment and the probability that each student is grading unbiasedly. The estimation errors have theoretical upper-bounds, and the bounds can be proved to tighten when the problem size increases, which is confirmed by our numerical experiment. © 2021 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,Peer-Grading at Scale with Rank Aggregation,Ling L.; Tan C.W.,"Ling, Lin (57203388295); Tan, Chee Wei (15072338600)",57203388295; 15072338600,Peer-Grading at Scale with Rank Aggregation,2021.0,L@S 2021 - Proceedings of the 8th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,327,330,3.0,1.0,10.1145/3430895.3460980,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108101635&doi=10.1145%2f3430895.3460980&partnerID=40&md5=97c378a220cc0383938a055f61d079ea,"City University of Hong Kong and Nautilus Software, Hong Kong, Hong Kong","Ling L., City University of Hong Kong and Nautilus Software, Hong Kong, Hong Kong; Tan C.W., City University of Hong Kong and Nautilus Software, Hong Kong, Hong Kong",massive open online courses; peer-grading; rank aggregation,E-learning; Personal computers; Personal computing; Students; Teaching; Estimation errors; Grading methods; Learning levels; Massive open online course; Modern educations; Numerical experiments; Online teaching; Rank aggregation; Grading,,,,,"University Grants Committee’s Teaching Development Grants, (6000710); Google; Innovation and Technology Fund, ITF, (TSSSU/18/03/1)","This research was funded in part through a Google Faculty Award grant, University Teaching Excellence Award grant, the University Grants Committee’s Teaching Development Grants (Project No. 6000710), and the Innovation and Technology Fund Project TSSSU/18/03/1.

Personalization at Scale: Making Learning Personally Relevant in a Climate Science MOOC,2021,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"Personalization and choice in learning activities can increase student engagement, satisfaction, and learning gains. But does this effect hold when implemented at scale? The current work explores the effects of personalization and learner's choice in a Climate Science MOOC. We manipulated these by creating two versions of course assignments. Learners who completed the assignments (N=219) received either Generic assignments focusing on global climate issues or Personalized assignments in which learners explored their own regions. Following the manipulation, learners in the Personalization group reported equal understanding of both Global and Local climate issues while learners in the Generic group reported better understanding of global issues and reduced understanding of local issues. Further, personalization did not affect interest or assignment length. We describe opportunities for personalization at scale and discuss their outcomes. © 2021 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,Personalization at Scale: Making Learning Personally Relevant in a Climate Science MOOC,Roll I.; Ram I.; Harris S.,"Roll, Ido (8987398200); Ram, Ilana (57193012254); Harris, Sara (7403485105)",8987398200; 57193012254; 7403485105,Personalization at Scale: Making Learning Personally Relevant in a Climate Science MOOC,2021.0,L@S 2021 - Proceedings of the 8th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,263,266,3.0,1.0,10.1145/3430895.3460154,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108060675&doi=10.1145%2f3430895.3460154&partnerID=40&md5=78d6e978e07f30da67d7a55b0791347b,"Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel; The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada","Roll I., Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel; Ram I., Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel; Harris S., The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada",learning design; mooc; personalization; value,Climate science; Global climates; Global issues; Learning Activity; Learning gain; Local climate; Personalizations; Student engagement,,,,,,,"A Shukor N., Abdullah Z., Using learning analytics to improve mooc instructional design, International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning (IJET), 14, 24, (2019); Cordova D.I., Lepper M.R., Intrinsic motivation and the process of learning: Beneficial effects of contextualization, personalization, and choice, Journal of Educational Psychology, 88, 4, (1996); Kizilcec R.F., Davis G.M., Cohen G.L., Towards equal opportunities in moocs: Affirmation reduces gender & social-class achievement gaps in china, Proceedings of the Fourth (2017) Acm Conference on Learning @ Scale, pp. 121-130, (2017); Pardo A., Jovanovic J., Dawson S., Gasevic D., Mirriahi N., Using learning analytics to scale the provision of 4ersonalized feedback: Learning analytics to scale 4ersonalized feedback, British Journal of Educational Technology, 50, 1, pp. 128-138, (2019); Roll I., Russell D.M., Gasevic D., Learning at scale, International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 28, 4, pp. 471-477, (2018); Roll I., Wylie R., Evolution and revolution in artificial intelligence in education, International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 26, 2, pp. 582-599, (2016); Walkington C., Bernacki M.L., Motivating students by personalizing"" learning around individual interests: A consideration of theory, design, and implementation issues, Motivational Interventions, 18, pp. 139-176, (2014); Watson S.L., Loizzo J., Watson W.R., Mueller C., Lim J., Ertmer P.A., Instructional design, facilitation, and perceived learning outcomes: An exploratory case study of a human trafficking mooc for attitudinal change, Educational Technology Research and Development, 64, 6, pp. 1273-1300, (2016); Novak P.Z., Zdravko K., The impact of the covid-19 pandemic in 2020 on the quality of stem higher education, Chemical Engineering Transactions, 81, pp. 1315-1320, (2020)",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,"8th Annual ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2021",22 June 2021 through 25 June 2021,"Virtual, Online",169423.0,,978-145038215-1,,,English,LS - Proc.

Due to the influence of COVID-19, the higher-education environment is rapidly shifting to an online environment in many institutions. Therefore, instructors need to transform lessons they have been doing in physical classrooms to an online format. However, just conducting the same talks online is not enough to provide students with satisfactory learning. Instructors need to redesign class content and structure to optimize them for the online environment. In this case study, the research team and an instructor redesigned an existing graduate school class into MOOC-like content.

Scaling Up Data Science Course Projects: A Case Study,2021,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"Large-scale, online Data Science (DS) courses and degree programs are becoming increasingly common due to the global rise in popularity and demand for data scientists. Although project-based learning is integral to gaining hands-on experience in DS education, providing fair, timely, and high-quality feedback on varied projects for a large number of diverse students is challenging. To address those challenges in scaling up the assessment of DS group projects, we integrated multiple techniques, such as rapid feedback, peer grading, graders as meta-reviewers, etc. We present a case study of deploying those strategies for group projects in a large online DS course titled Text Information Systems offered in Fall, 2020. We synthesize our findings from analyzing student and grader survey responses, and share useful lessons and future work. © 2021 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,Scaling up Data Science Course Projects: A Case Study,Bhavya B.; Xiao J.; Zhai C.,"Bhavya, Bhavya (57224636404); Xiao, Jinfeng (57193614861); Zhai, Chengxiang (35232046000)",57224636404; 57193614861; 35232046000,Scaling up Data Science Course Projects: A Case Study,2021.0,L@S 2021 - Proceedings of the 8th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,311,314,3.0,2.0,10.1145/3430895.3460168,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108066813&doi=10.1145%2f3430895.3460168&partnerID=40&md5=be0eb87ed0f3c239ebfb375093a29d4d,"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, United States","Bhavya B., University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, United States; Xiao J., University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, United States; Zhai C., University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, United States",course projects; data science education; scalable assessment,Electronic assessment; Grading; Online systems; Degree program; Group projects; High quality; Project based learning; Rapid feedback; Scaling-up; Science course; Data Science,,,,,,,"Badea G., Popescu E., Using learneval peer assessment platform in project-based learning settings: A first experience report, 2019 18th International Conference on Information Technology Based Higher Education and Training (ITHET, pp. 1-5, (2019); Boughoula B.A., Green A., Zhai C., Collective development of large scale data science products via modularized assignments: An experience report, Proceedings of the 51st Acm SIGCSE., pp. 1200-1206, (2020); Cambre J., Klemmer S., Kulkarni C., Juxtapeer: Comparative peer review yields higher quality feedback and promotes deeper reflection, Proceedings of the 2018 CHI., pp. 1-13, (2018); Geigle C., Lourentzou I., Sundaram H., Zhai C., Clads: A cloud-based virtual lab for the delivery of scalable hands-on assignments for practical data science education, Proceedings of the 23rd Annual Acm Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education., pp. 176-181, (2018); Joyner D.A., Ashby W., Irish L., Lam Y., Langston J., Lupiani I., Lustig M., Pettoruto P., Sheahen D., Smiley A., Graders as meta-reviewers: Simultaneously scaling and improving expert evaluation for large online classrooms, Proceedings of the Third (2016) Acm L@S., pp. 399-408, (2016); Kulkarni C., Wei K.P., Le H., Chia D., Papadopoulos K., Cheng J., Koller D., Klemmer S.R., Peer and self assessment in massive online classes, Acm Tochi, 20, 6, pp. 1-31, (2013); Kulkarni C.E., Bernstein M.S., Klemmer S.R., Peerstudio: Rapid peer feedback emphasizes revision and improves performance, Proceedings of the Second (2015) Acm L@S., pp. 75-84, (2015); Mann H.B., Whitney D.R., On a test of whether one of two random variables is stochastically larger than the other, The Annals of Mathematical Statistics, pp. 50-60, (1947); Ramamurthy B., A practical and sustainable model for learning and teaching data science, Proceedings of the 47th Acm Technical Symposium on Computing Science Education., pp. 169-174, (2016); Ravikiran M., Systematic Review of Approaches to Improve Peer Assessment at Scale, (2020); Rovai A.P., Wighting M.J., Feelings of alienation and community among higher education students in a virtual classroom, The Internet and Higher Education, 8, 2, pp. 97-110, (2005); Usher M., Barak M., Peer assessment in a project-based engineering course: Comparing between on-campus and online learning environments, Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education, 43, 5, pp. 745-759, (2018)",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,"8th Annual ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2021",22 June 2021 through 25 June 2021,"Virtual, Online",169423.0,,978-145038215-1,,,English,LS - Proc.

Second Workshop on Educational A/B Testing at Scale,2021,Full Paper,Workshops,"The emerging discipline of Learning Engineering is focused on putting into place tools and processes that use the science of learning as a basis for improving educational outcomes. An important part of Learning Engineering focuses on improving the effectiveness of educational software. In many software domains, A/B testing has become a prominent technique to achieve the software's goals. Many large companies (Amazon, Google, Facebook, etc.) run thousands of AB tests and present at the Annual Conference on Digital Experimentation (CODE), but that venue is too broad to address AB testing issues specific to EdTech platforms. We see a need to address issues with running large-scale A/B tests within the educational context, where the use of A/B testing lags other industries. This workshop will explore ways in which A/B testing in educational contexts differs from other domains and proposals to overcome current challenges so that this approach can become a more useful tool in the learning engineer's toolbox. © 2021 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,Second Workshop on Educational A/B Testing at Scale,Ritter S.; Heffernan N.; Williams J.J.; Lomas D.; Bicknell K.,"Ritter, Steve (35732151500); Heffernan, Neil (14041775100); Williams, Joseph Jay (56159570600); Lomas, Derek (36617843000); Bicknell, Klinton (35767508100)",35732151500; 14041775100; 56159570600; 36617843000; 35767508100,Second Workshop on Educational A/B Testing at Scale,2021.0,L@S 2021 - Proceedings of the 8th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,311,314,3.0,1.0,10.1145/3430895.3460876,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108082143&doi=10.1145%2f3430895.3460876&partnerID=40&md5=47ada3e6cbcc0d871752f5e17dd2a001,"Carnegie Learning, Pittsburgh, PA, United States; Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA, United States; University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; Delft University of Technology, Delft, Netherlands; Duolingo, Pittsburgh, PA, United States","Ritter S., Carnegie Learning, Pittsburgh, PA, United States; Heffernan N., Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA, United States; Williams J.J., University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; Lomas D., Delft University of Technology, Delft, Netherlands; Bicknell K., Duolingo, Pittsburgh, PA, United States",a/b testing; educational software; experimentation,A/b testing; Educational context; Educational software; Facebook; Large companies; Software domains; Software testing,,,,,,,"Simon H.A., The job of a college president, Educational Record, 48, pp. 68-78, (1967); Uncapher M.R., From the science of learning (and development) to learning engineering, Applied Developmental Science, (2018); Kohavi R., Deng A., Frasca B., Walker T., Xu Y., Pohlmann N., Online controlled experiments at large scale, Proceedings of the 19th Acm Sigkdd International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 1168-1176, (2013)",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,"8th Annual ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2021",22 June 2021 through 25 June 2021,"Virtual, Online",169423.0,,978-145038215-1,,,English,LS - Proc.

"Setting up, Troubleshooting, and Innovating on the Delivery of Online Instruction: A Case Study of an LMS Q&A Forum",2021,Full Paper,L@Scale 2: Perspectives from US West Coast,"With the recent surge in online teaching, increasing numbers of instructors are using learning management systems (LMSs) to migrate their courses online and adapt their teaching methods. Given the steep learning curve for these feature-rich software applications, many instructors turn to online Q&A forums for help with learning and troubleshooting their LMS. We analyzed the content of 250 posts from a community-based Q&A forum for Canvas, a widely-used LMS, finding several recurring themes that illustrate how instructors are setting up courses for the first time, facilitating shared experiences between their students, and even seeking innovative ways to customize their course delivery. Our findings shed light on key barriers driving instructors to seek help and to what extent their help needs are actually addressed by the community. We discuss several opportunities for improving the design of LMSs and for better understanding and supporting instructors' custom needs to enhance their course delivery. © 2021 ACM.",,,,,,100,"Setting up, Troubleshooting, and Innovating on the Delivery of Online Instruction: A Case Study of an LMS Q&A Forum",Ramesh K.; Vermette L.; Chilana P.K.,"Ramesh, Kavana (57224637395); Vermette, Laton (57196192180); Chilana, Parmit K.

Should College Dropout Prediction Models Include Protected Attributes?  91-100,2021,Full Paper,L@Scale 2: Perspectives from US West Coast,"Early identification of college dropouts can provide tremendous value for improving student success and institutional effectiveness, and predictive analytics are increasingly used for this purpose. However, ethical concerns have emerged about whether including protected attributes in these prediction models discriminates against underrepresented student groups and exacerbates existing inequities. We examine this issue in the context of a large U.S. research university with both residential and fully online degree-seeking students. Based on comprehensive institutional records for the entire student population across multiple years (N = 93,457), we build machine learning models to predict student dropout after one academic year of study and compare the overall performance and fairness of model predictions with or without four protected attributes (gender, URM, first-generation student, and high financial need). We find that including protected attributes does not impact the overall prediction performance and it only marginally improves the algorithmic fairness of predictions. These findings suggest that including protected attributes is preferable. We offer guidance on how to evaluate the impact of including protected attributes in a local context, where institutional stakeholders seek to leverage predictive analytics to support student success. © 2021 Owner/Author.",,,,,,95,Should College Dropout Prediction Models Include Protected Attributes?,Yu R.; Lee H.; Kizilcec R.F.,"Yu, Renzhe (57203392525); Lee, Hansol (57219768327); Kizilcec, René F.

"Student Barriers to Active Learning in Synchronous Online Classes: Characterization, Reflections, and Suggestions",2021,Full Paper,L@Scale 3: Perspectives from Oceania,"As more and more face-to-face classes move to online environments, it becomes increasingly important to explore any emerging barriers to students' learning. This work focuses on characterizing student barriers to active learning in synchronous online environments. The aim is to help novice educators develop a better understanding of those barriers and prepare more student-centered course plans for their active online classes. Towards this end, we adopt a qualitative research approach and study information from different sources: social media content, interviews, and surveys from students and expert educators. Through a thematic analysis, we craft a nuanced list of students' online active learning barriers within the themes of human-side, technological, and environmental barriers. Each barrier is explored from the three aspects of frequency, importance, and exclusiveness to active online classes. Finally, we conduct a summative study with 12 novice educators and explain the benefits of using our barrier list for course planning in active online classes. © 2021 ACM.",,,,,,100,"Student Barriers to Active Learning in Synchronous Online Classes: Characterization, Reflections, and Suggestions",Hadi Mogavi R.; Zhao Y.; Ul Haq E.; Hui P.; Ma X.,"Hadi Mogavi, Reza (57223128215); Zhao, Yankun (57223820407); Ul Haq, Ehsan (57205283169); Hui, Pan (14029922900); Ma, Xiaojuan (56242668800)",57223128215; 57223820407; 57205283169; 14029922900; 56242668800,"Student Barriers to Active Learning in Synchronous Online Classes: Characterization, Reflections, and Suggestions",2021.0,L@S 2021 - Proceedings of the 8th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,101,115,14.0,14.0,10.1145/3430895.3460126,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108104080&doi=10.1145%2f3430895.3460126&partnerID=40&md5=272f6423653afadafc405d6b16aba905,"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, University of Helsinki, Hong Kong, Hong Kong","Hadi Mogavi R., Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, University of Helsinki, Hong Kong, Hong Kong; Zhao Y., Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, University of Helsinki, Hong Kong, Hong Kong; Ul Haq E., Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, University of Helsinki, Hong Kong, Hong Kong; Hui P., Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, University of Helsinki, Hong Kong, Hong Kong; Ma X., Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, University of Helsinki, Hong Kong, Hong Kong",active learning; interaction; pedagogy; student-centered education; synchronous online classes,Students; Active Learning; Course planning; Course plans; Face to face; Online environments; Qualitative research; Social media; Thematic analysis; E-learning,,,,,"Suomen Akatemia; Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee, RGC, UGC, (T44-707/16-N)","Here, we want to thank all of the research participants who kindly took part in our work and made it possible.

Student Perceptions of Social Support in the Transition to Emergency Remote Instruction,2021,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"University courses around the world suddenly transitioned to emergency remote instruction in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We study changes in students' experience of support from their instructors and peers in large lecture courses. Social support can act as an important resource for students and buffer against mental distress. We find that students experienced more support from instructors but less support from their peers after the transition to remote instruction. Remote learning was less active and involved fewer peer interactions, with synchronous classes resembling online office hours and students struggling to get help. Our findings suggest the need for additional resources to help students stay connected and facilitate collaboration online. © 2021 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,Student Perceptions of Social Support in the Transition to Emergency Remote Instruction,Cho J.Y.; Wilkie Tomasik I.; Yang H.; Kizilcec R.F.,"Cho, Ji Yong (57202043077); Wilkie Tomasik, Ian (57224629319); Yang, Hui (57195136312); Kizilcec, René F.

Teaching the Masses on Twitch: An Initial Exploration of Educational Live-Streaming,2021,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"Streaming games and entertainment content are established formats on large portals like YouTube and Twitch. Educational streams have not yet reached the same popularity. Consequently, the existing research of gaming streams by far exceeds the research of live-streaming lectures. In this paper, we contribute first insights regarding this area, outline the status quo of the edu-streaming ecosystem, and highlight common approaches and characteristics. Through a descriptive study of 100 popular gaming streams, we systemize the inductively found features and approaches that are seen in both ecosystems. With a further focus on 20 educational streams, we highlight features such as synchronous community building and on-stream interactivity. We project the main differences between the core characteristics of MOOCs and educational streams. Finally, we propose further research directions for the emerging field of public, synchronous online education. © 2021 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,Teaching the Masses on Twitch: An Initial Exploration of Educational Live-Streaming,Steinbeck H.; Teusner R.; Meinel C.,"Steinbeck, Hendrik (57215899166); Teusner, Ralf (55810128500); Meinel, Christoph (56187776800)",57215899166; 55810128500; 56187776800,Teaching the Masses on Twitch: An Initial Exploration of Educational Live-Streaming,2021.0,L@S 2021 - Proceedings of the 8th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,275,278,3.0,3.0,10.1145/3430895.3460157,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108067886&doi=10.1145%2f3430895.3460157&partnerID=40&md5=12de48987ecf03652d78400cbd5ab2dc,"Hasso Plattner Institute, University of Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany","Steinbeck H., Hasso Plattner Institute, University of Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany; Teusner R., Hasso Plattner Institute, University of Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany; Meinel C., Hasso Plattner Institute, University of Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany",public lecture; streaming; synchronous classrooms; twitch,Distance education; Community buildings; Descriptive studies; Initial exploration; Interactivity; Live streaming; On-line education; Status quo; YouTube; Ecosystems,,,,,,,"Espino J.M.S., Suarez M.D.A., Gonzalez-Henriquez J.J., Video for teaching: Classroom use, instructor self-production and teachers' preferences in presentation format, Technology, Pedagogy and Education, 29, 2, pp. 147-162, (2020); Haaranen L., Programming as a performance: Live-streaming and its implications for computer science education, Proceedings of the 2017 Acm Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education (ITiCSE '17), (2017); Hamilton W.A., Garretson O., Kerne A., Streaming on twitch: Fostering participatory communities of play within live mixed media, Proceedings of the Sigchi Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI '14, pp. 1315-1324, (2014); Hudgins W., Lynch M., Schmal A., Sikka H., Swenson M., Joyner D.A., Informal learning communities: The other massive open online 'c, Proceedings of the Seventh Acm Conference on Learning @ Scale (L@S '20), pp. 91-101, (2020); Jones T., Cuthrell K., Youtube: Educational potentials and pitfalls, Computers in the Schools, 28, (2011); Joyner D.A., Wang Q., Thakare S., Jing S., Goel A., MacIntyre B., The synchronicity paradox in online education, Proceedings of the Seventh Acm Conference on Learning @ Scale (L@S '20), pp. 15-24, (2020); Kaytoue M., Silva A., Cerf L., Meira W., Raissi C., Watch me playing, i am a professional: A first study on video game live streaming, Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on World Wide Web (WWW '12 Companion, pp. 1181-1188, (2012); Kukulska-Hulme A., Beirne E., Conole G., Innovating Pedagogy: Open University Innovation Report 8, (2020); Payne K., Keith M.J., Schuetzler R.M., Scott Giboney J., Examining the learning effects of live streaming video game instruction over twitch, Computers in Human Behavior, 77, pp. 95-109, (2017); Scully-Blaker R., Begy J., Consalvo M., Ganzon S., Playing along and Playing for on Twitch: Livestreaming from Tandem Play to Performance, (2017); State of the Stream December and 2020 Year in Review, (2021); Twitch Stats and Analysis, (2021); Taylor T.L., Watch Me Play: Twitch and the Rise of Game Live Streaming, (2018); Twitchmetrics-Streamers and Gamers, (2021); Wohn D., Freeman G., Audience Management Practices of Live Streamers on Twitch, pp. 106-116, (2020); Yang X., Gao S., Understanding the values of live game streaming: A value-focused thinking approach, vol, Proceedings of the Wuhan International Conference on E-Business.

The Impact of Mobile Learning on Students' Self-Test Behavior in MOOCs,2021,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"Students can use personal mobile devices to access Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) in addition to desktop computers. However, user interfaces are often only scaled to smaller screen sizes and interaction patterns of a desktop learning experience do not always fit well with the characteristics of mobile devices. Adequate solutions for answering self-test questions on mobile devices often do not exist. In this paper, we explore the currently shown interaction patterns of MOOC learners when answering self-tests to make an informed decision about the requirements for the appropriate solution on mobile devices. The students' context was categorized into Desktop Web, Mobile Web, and Mobile Application. In an observational case study, the interaction events of two courses were analyzed regarding these device groups. Desktop Web is the most used environment. No practical differences between device groups were identified for subsequent attempts. Learners stick to a single device group and often only participate once in a self-test. Also, learners using mobile applications spend more time submitting self-tests. © 2021 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,The Impact of Mobile Learning on Students' Self-Test Behavior in MOOCs,Bothe M.; Meinel C.,"Bothe, Max (57190375436); Meinel, Christoph (56187776800)",57190375436; 56187776800,The Impact of Mobile Learning on Students' Self-Test Behavior in MOOCs,2021.0,L@S 2021 - Proceedings of the 8th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,251,254,3.0,0.0,10.1145/3430895.3460151,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108109188&doi=10.1145%2f3430895.3460151&partnerID=40&md5=4328a0a11f33ae4bb740a0e8b4a605e8,"Hasso Plattner Institute, Potsdam, Germany","Bothe M., Hasso Plattner Institute, Potsdam, Germany; Meinel C., Hasso Plattner Institute, Potsdam, Germany",mobile learning; MOOCs; spaced repetition learning,Mobile computing; Personal computers; Students; User interfaces; Informed decision; Interaction pattern; Learning experiences; Massive open online course; Mobile applications; Mobile Learning; Personal mobile devices; Students' contexts; E-learning,,,,,,,"Ausubel D.P., Youssef M., The effect of spaced repetition on meaningful retention, The Journal of General Psychology, 73, 1, pp. 147-150, (1965); Bothe M., Renz J., Meinel C., On the acceptance and effects of recapping self-test questions in moocs, 2020 Ieee Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), pp. 264-272, (2020); Chen Q., Yan Z., Does multitasking with mobile phones affect learning?

"The MOOClet Framework: Unifying Experimentation, Dynamic Improvement, and Personalization in Online Courses",2021,Full Paper,L@Scale 1: Perspectives from North America,"How can educational platforms be instrumented to accelerate the use of research to improve students' experiences? We show how modular components of any educational interface-e.g. explanations, homework problems, even emails-can be implemented using the novel MOOClet software architecture. Researchers and instructors can use these augmented MOOClet components for: (1) Iterative Cycles of Randomized Experiments that test alternative versions of course content; (2) Data-Driven Improvement using adaptive experiments that rapidly use data to give better versions of content to future students, on the order of days rather than months. A MOOClet supports both manual and automated improvement using reinforcement learning; (3) Personalization by delivering alternative versions as a function of data about a student's characteristics or subgroup, using both expert-authored rules and data mining algorithms. We provide an open-source web service for implementing MOOClets (www.mooclet.org) that has been used with thousands of students.

Toward Effective Courseware at Scale: Investigating Automatically Generated Questions as Formative Practice,2021,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"Courseware is a comprehensive learning environment that engages students in a learning by doing approach while also giving instructors data-driven insights on their class, providing a scalable solution for many instructional models. However, courseware-and the volume of formative questions required to make it effective-is time-consuming and expensive to create. By using artificial intelligence for automatic question generation, we can reduce the time and cost of developing formative questions in courseware. However, it is critical that automatically generated (AG) questions have a level of quality on par with human-authored (HA) questions in order to be confident in their usage at scale. Therefore, our research question is: are student interactions with AG questions equivalent to HA questions with respect to engagement, difficulty, and persistence metrics? This paper evaluates data for AG and HA questions that students used as formative practice in their university Communication course.

Toward Personalizing Students' Education with Crowdsourced Tutoring,2021,Full Paper,L@Scale 1: Perspectives from North America,"As more educators integrate their curricula with online learning, it is easier to crowdsource content from them. Crowdsourced tutoring has been proven to reliably increase students' next problem correctness. In this work, we confirmed the findings of a previous study in this area, with stronger confidence margins than previously, and revealed that only a portion of crowdsourced content creators had a reliable benefit to students. Furthermore, this work provides a method to rank content creators relative to each other, which was used to determine which content creators were most effective overall, and which content creators were most effective for specific groups of students. When exploring data from TeacherASSIST, a feature within the ASSISTments learning platform that crowdsources tutoring from teachers, we found that while overall this program provides a benefit to students, some teachers created more effective content than others. Despite this finding, we did not find evidence that the effectiveness of content reliably varied by student knowledge-level, suggesting that the content is unlikely suitable for personalizing instruction based on student knowledge alone. These findings are promising for the future of crowdsourced tutoring as they help provide a foundation for assessing the quality of crowdsourced content and investigating content for opportunities to personalize students' education. © 2021 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,Toward Personalizing Students' Education with Crowdsourced Tutoring,Prihar E.;

Toward Reshaping the Syllabus for Education at Scale,2021,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"Ensuring that students are fully informed about course content and policies is always a challenge, but online education at scale adds additional complications. In this paper we present observations about the place of the syllabus in education at scale, based on the actual syllabus documents from 48 courses in a Computer Science Master's degree program offered online and at scale. On the basis of these observations, we offer preliminary recommendations for factors that instructors should keep in mind when they compile a syllabus for similar courses. © 2021 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,Toward Reshaping the Syllabus for Education at Scale,Eicher B.L.; Joyner D.,"Eicher, Bobbie Lynn (57202432695); Joyner, David (35183234600)",57202432695; 35183234600,Toward Reshaping the Syllabus for Education at Scale,2021.0,L@S 2021 - Proceedings of the 8th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,355,358,3.0,4.0,10.1145/3430895.3460987,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108094748&doi=10.1145%2f3430895.3460987&partnerID=40&md5=b5b01637ae5d9df8d27ff7aa51a3c610,"Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States","Eicher B.L., Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States; Joyner D., Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States",adult education; auto-grading; grading; online learning; peer-grading; project-based learning; scaling assessments; syllabus,Curricula; Distance education; Course contents; Master's degree; On-line education; Education computing,,,,,,,"Benoliel U., Becher S.I., The duty to read the unreadable, Boston College Law Review, 60, 8, pp. 2255-2296, (2019); Duncan A., Eicher B., Joyner D.A., Enrollment motivations in an online graduate cs program: Trends & gender-And age-based differences, Proceedings of the 51st Acm Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE '20), pp. 1241-1247, (2020); Eicher B.L., Joyner D., Components of assessments and grading at scale, Proceedings of the Eighth Acm Conference on Learning @ Scale (L@S '21), (2021); Fornaciari C.J., Dean K.L., The 21st-century syllabus: From pedagogy to andragogy, Journal of Management Education, 38, 5, pp. 701-723, (2014); Gerbe O., Raynauld J., An Open Syllabus Model, 1, (2009); Joyner D., Squeezing the limeade: Policies and workflows for scalable online degrees, Proceedings of the Fifth Annual Acm Conference on Learning at Scale., pp. 1-10, (2018); Joyner D.A., Isbell C., Starner T., Goel A., Five years of graduate cs education online and at scale, Proceedings of the Acm Conference on Global Computing Education., pp. 16-22, (2019); Kim M., The creative commons and copyright protection in the digital era: Uses of creative commons licenses, Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 13, 1, pp. 187-209, (2007); Mason T., Gavrilovska A., Joyner D.A., Collaboration versus cheating: Reducing code plagiarism in an online ms computer science program, Proceedings of the 50th Acm Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE '19), pp. 1004-1010, (2019); Parkes J., Harris M.B., The purposes of a syllabus, College Teaching, 50, 2, pp. 55-61, (2002); Waller R., Contract Design for Humans: Preventing Cognitive Accidents, (2020)",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,"8th Annual ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2021",22 June 2021 through 25 June 2021,"Virtual, Online",169423.0,,978-145038215-1,,,English,LS - Proc.

Using Social Norms to Promote Actions Beyond the Course,2021,Full Paper,L@Scale 4: Perspectives from Europe and US,"Educators and researchers in online education have grappled with not only how to increase course completion but also how to make a broader impact that goes beyond online courses, such as course participants' real-world applications of the learned knowledge and skills. Research in social psychology and behavioral science suggests that social norms interventions, which convey norms shared in the community that people belong in to promote desirable behaviors, can offer a low-cost and scalable approach to encourage actions beyond the courses (ABCs). We tested three social norm interventions that presented a weekly normative message (descriptive, dynamic, or injunctive norm) with aggregate information about course participants' ABCs in the prior week. Randomized experiments in three online courses found effects on ABCs to be weak and moderated by norm message type and the complexity of the target behavior. Although the interventions did not improve course completion, the dynamic norm message was more effective at promoting ABCs for complex behaviors, such as developing environmental education activities. © 2021 ACM.",,,,,,100,Using Social Norms to Promote Actions beyond the Course,Cho J.Y.; Li Y.; Armstrong A.K.; Russ A.; Krasny M.E.; Kizilcec R.F.,"Cho, Ji Yong (57202043077); Li, Yue (56448682500); Armstrong, Anne K.

What do I need to know? Designing Student Learning Tools that Aid Interaction with Recorded Lecture Content,2021,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"This paper presents an exploratory investigation of how students might benefit from recorded class lectures. Our overarching goal is to inform design of an artificial intelligence (AI) tool that adds value to lecture recordings. To study this possibility, we surveyed undergraduate students about their active learning strategies and their visions of how AI might help them to engage more richly with digitized learning materials. We report our findings and discuss implications for design of a tool that can add value to recorded lectures; we also consider more generally the possibilities of using lecture recordings to enhance student learning. © 2021 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,What do i need to know?

What's In It for the Learners? Evidence from a Randomized Field Experiment on Learnersourcing Questions in a MOOC,2021,Full Paper,L@Scale 5: Perspectives from US East Coast,"Question generation as a form of learnersourcing is both a metacognitive learning activity for students that encourages the development of higher-order thinking skills and a method for producing question banks and assessments. To better understand the motivations for learners who engage in learnersourcing and its impacts on student learning, we conducted an experiment that measured the effects of Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) generation in an introductory data science MOOC. We compared two approaches to question generation: (i) as a required activity, and (ii) as an optional activity. In both cases, the learnersourcing activity was part of the student summative evaluation. We found that learners value creating questions more, and create higher quality questions when they choose to do so compared to when it is required. At the same time there is a significant reduction in instructor evaluation workload in large-scale courses when learners engage by choice due to self-selection. Thus, we propose choice-based learnersourcing as a new form of scalable personalized learning design for MOOCs in particular. In addition, we contribute an exploration of the factors that influence learner choice to create (or not create) an MCQ, which can help contextualize the propensity of learners to engage in such learnersourcing activities. © 2021 ACM.",,,,,,100,What's in It for the Learners?

What's the Point? How Scores Undermine Written Comments on Open-Ended Work,2021,Full Paper,L@Scale 3: Perspectives from Oceania,"Scaling assessments typically relies on quantifying work quality, yet written comments are the assessment method of choice for open-ended work. Existing scalable solutions compromise by mapping quality scores to pre-authored comments, but how scores influence interpretation of these comments is not well understood. We report results from a study of how 441 participants authored and revised short stories in response to a score, written comments, both types of feedback, or no feedback. We analyzed data from the story-writing task and two surveys to determine task and feedback satisfaction, revision depth and effort, and improvement between drafts for each participant. We found task satisfaction and task performance were positively correlated among participants who were shown a score. Feedback satisfaction, revision effort, and improvement were highest among participants shown written comments. Either type of feedback prompted more deep revisions than no feedback, but together elicited fewer deep revisions than written comments alone. Our work informs the design of scalable open-ended assessment systems by contributing insights regarding how scores influence perceptions of written feedback and subsequent revision outcomes. © 2021 ACM.",,,,,,100,What's the Point?

With or Without EU: Navigating GDPR Constraints in Human Subjects Research in an Education Environment,2021,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), passed in 2018, outlined new data privacy standards applying to residents of the European Union (EU). The impact of this law stretches beyond the EU to anyone-such as researchers across the world-collecting or processing data from EU residents. Researchers have had to augment their methodologies to ensure GDPR compliance. This initiative intersects with at-scale educational programs, which often enroll EU students and are also often the subject of institutional research. While creating a study to research students in an online Master of Science in Computer Science (MSCS) program, some of whom are in the EU, we encountered difficulties with ensuring GDPR compliance. This paper discusses the implications of the GDPR related to both general research and our specific study. We discuss the challenges of interpreting the GDPR and integrating it into our methodology as well as potential solutions, our ultimate resolution, and practical recommendations, and we consider what the future of data privacy legislation means for researchers. © 2021 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,With or without EU: Navigating GDPR Constraints in Human Subjects Research in an Education Environment,Duncan A.; Joyner D.A.,"Duncan, Alex (57210732436); Joyner, David A.

A Machine Learning Approach for Understanding the Educational Foci and Technical Solutions of AIED,2023,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"This work-in-progress paper employs a machine learning method for the automated analysis of research interests in Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) at scale. We aim to analyze the essential techniques and critical educational problems studied by researchers in five AIED-related conferences and journals between 2010 and 2022. We trained and compared different machine learning models and feature extraction techniques to achieve the research objective. After comparing different models and hyperparameter combinations, our classifier achieves an accuracy of 0.87 and Cohen's kappa of 0.80. Based on the classification results, we identified the top 10 most frequent keywords within each category for every four year period over the past 12 years. Using the classifier, the 10,723 keywords from 2,684 articles were classified into three categories: educational foci, technical solutions, and AIED applications. We find that 'natural language processing' and 'machine learning' are the primary technical keywords in AIED research, and 'deep learning' and 'artificial intelligence' are the trending technical keywords since 2017. Meanwhile, 'massive open online courses', 'self-regulated learning', 'feedback', 'collaborative learning', and 'online learning' are the top educational foci in the field over the last 12 years. 'Intelligent tutoring systems', 'educational data mining', 'knowledge tracing', and 'learning analytics' continue to receive attention as AIED applications of sustained interest. This study helps to understand the educational foci and technical solutions of AIED research at scale and provides insights into the future of AIED research. © 2023 ACM.",,,,,,100,A Machine Learning Approach for Understanding the Educational Foci and Technical Solutions of AIED,Liu H.; Feng S.; Qiao C.,"Liu, Hahohua (58535452500); Feng, Shihui (57190013027); Qiao, Chen (57202910808)",58535452500; 57190013027; 57202910808,A Machine Learning Approach for Understanding the Educational Foci and Technical Solutions of AIED,2023.0,L@S 2023 - Proceedings of the 10th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,326,330,4.0,0.0,10.1145/3573051.3596181,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85167866450&doi=10.1145%2f3573051.3596181&partnerID=40&md5=5eabce5e0d0d8e6a34c1e83fae1b2b88,"Faculty of Education, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong; Faculty of Education, Institute of Data Science, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong; School of Biomedical Sciences, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong","Liu H., Faculty of Education, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong; Feng S., Faculty of Education, Institute of Data Science, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong; Qiao C., School of Biomedical Sciences, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong",artificial intelligence in education; classification; machine learning,Computer aided instruction; Deep learning; E-learning; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Artificial intelligence in education; Automated analysis; Education research; Educational problems; Machine learning approaches; Machine learning methods; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Research interests; Technical solutions; Data mining,,,,,"HKU Seed Fund for Basic Research for New Staff; University of Hong Kong, HKU",This work was partially funded by the HKU Seed Fund for Basic Research for New Staff and HKU Startup Fund (SF).,"Bai Y., Li H., Liu Y., Visualizing research trends and research theme evolution in E-learning field: 1999-2018, Scientometrics, 126, pp. 1389-1414, (2021); Bhutoria A., Personalized education and Artificial Intelligence in the United States, China, and India: A systematic review using a Human-In-The-Loop model, Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence, 3, (2022); Charitopoulos A., Rangoussi M., Koulouriotis D., On the use of soft computing methods in educational data mining and learning analytics research: A reviewof years 2010-2018, International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 30, pp. 371-430, (2020); Dai C., Ke F., Educational applications of artificial intelligence in simulation-based learning: A systematic mapping review, Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence, (2022); Feng S., Law N., Mapping artificial intelligence in education research: A network-based keyword analysis, International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 31, pp. 277-303, (2021); Rahayu N.W., Ferdiana R., Kusumawardani S.S., A systematic review of ontology use in E-Learning recommender system, Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence, (2022); Su J., Yang W., Artificial intelligence in early childhood education: A scoping review, Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence, (2022)",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",ACM,"10th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale, L@S 2023",20 July 2023 through 22 July 2023,Copenhagen,190884.0,,979-840070025-5,,,English,L@S - Proc.

A Scalable Architecture for Conducting A/B Experiments in Educational Settings,2023,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"A/B experiments are commonly used in research to compare the effects of changing one or more variables in two different experimental groups-a control group and a treatment group. While the benefits of using A/B experiments are widely known and accepted in education, there is less agreement on an approach to creating software infrastructure systems to assist in rapidly conducting such experiments in the field. To assist in alleviating this gap, we are creating a software infrastructure for A/B experiments that allows researchers to conduct experiments and automatically analyze their results for an education-focused ecology-based conceptual modeling platform. © 2023 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,A Scalable Architecture for Conducting A/B Experiments in Educational Settings,Hornback A.; Buckley S.; Kos J.; Bunin S.; An S.; Joyner D.; Goel A.,"Hornback, Andrew (57748933300); Buckley, Stephen (58535510300); Kos, John (58535438700); Bunin, Scott (57748933200); An, Sungeun (56959799300); Joyner, David (35183234600); Goel, Ashok (7201830074)",57748933300; 58535510300; 58535438700; 57748933200; 56959799300; 35183234600; 7201830074,A Scalable Architecture for Conducting A/B Experiments in Educational Settings,2023.0,L@S 2023 - Proceedings of the 10th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,373,377,4.0,0.0,10.1145/3573051.3596190,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85167865578&doi=10.1145%2f3573051.3596190&partnerID=40&md5=8cf3849887d2483f89cf9a4bfcbc7675,"Design & Intelligence Laboratory, School of Interactive Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States","Hornback A., Design & Intelligence Laboratory, School of Interactive Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States; Buckley S., Design & Intelligence Laboratory, School of Interactive Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States; Kos J., Design & Intelligence Laboratory, School of Interactive Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States; Bunin S., Design & Intelligence Laboratory, School of Interactive Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States; An S., Design & Intelligence Laboratory, School of Interactive Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States; Joyner D., Design & Intelligence Laboratory, School of Interactive Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States; Goel A., Design & Intelligence Laboratory, School of Interactive Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States",A/B experiments,A/B experiment; Conceptual model; Control groups; Educational settings; Experimental groups; Infrastructure systems; Modeling platforms; Scalable architectures; Software infrastructure; Treatment group; Computer programming,,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF, (DRL-2112532)","This research is supported by the National Science Foundation under Cooperative Agreement DRL-2112532 with the National AI Institute for Adult Learning and Online Education (aialoe.org).

Comb: Giving Feedback to Short Answer at Scale with Human-in-the-Loop Rubric Creation,2023,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"As enrollment in college classes rises, it is increasingly difficult to grade and provide feedback to open-ended assignments. It is a timeconsuming and labor-intensive task for instructors, especially when the grading criteria are subjective and constantly evolving. Rubrics are often used to standardize grading, but they can be challenging to create and may not always capture the nuances of a particular assignment. Additionally, it can be difficult to articulate principles or constraints that define a ""good""solution in less well-defined domains; like human-computer interaction (HCI) [3, 8] or user experience (UX) [7]. Instructors may delegate the task of grading and offering feedback to a number of graders. However, through our co-design study (section 2.1), we've found that inter-grader reliability, managing time constraints, and dealing with unclear rubrics are just some of the many issues faced by graders in this process. © 2023 ACM.",,,,,,100,Comb: Giving Feedback to Short Answer at Scale with Human-in-the-Loop Rubric Creation,Kok C.; Wang X.,"Kok, Christopher (58535445000); Wang, Xu (57190019684)",58535445000; 57190019684,Comb: Giving Feedback to Short Answer at Scale with Human-in-the-Loop Rubric Creation,2023.0,L@S 2023 - Proceedings of the 10th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,398,400,2.0,0.0,10.1145/3573051.3596195,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85167868431&doi=10.1145%2f3573051.3596195&partnerID=40&md5=ff54cc393b0857531ab785c3f709cdc5,"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States","Kok C., University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States; Wang X., University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States",applied natural language processing; automatic feedback; educational technology; human-in-the-loop; short answer grading,Educational technology; Human computer interaction; Natural language processing systems; Applied natural language processing; Automatic feedback; Co-designs; Grading criteria; Human-in-the-loop; Labour-intensive; Language processing; Natural languages; Short answer grading; Users' experiences; Grading,,,,,,,"Andersen N., Zehner F., shinyReCoR: A Shiny Application for Automatically Coding Text Responses Using R, Psych, 3, 3, pp. 422-446, (2021); Andersen N., Zehner F., Goldhammer F., Semi-automatic coding of open-ended text responses in large-scale assessments, Journal of Computer Assisted Learning, (2022); Churchill E.F., Bowser A., Preece J., The Future of HCI Education: A Flexible, Global, Living Curriculum, Interactions, 23, 2, pp. 70-73, (2016); Galhardi L.B., Brancher J.D., Machine Learning Approach for Automatic Short Answer Grading: A Systematic Review, Advances in Artificial Intelligence-IBERAMIA 2018, pp. 380-391, (2018); Gebreegziabher S.A., Zhang Z., Tang X., Meng Y., Glassman E., Jia-Jun Li T., PaTAT: Human-AI Collaborative Qalitative Coding with Explainable Interactive Rule Synthesis, CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, (2023); Haller S., Aldea A., Seifert C., Strisciuglio N., Survey on Automated Short Answer Grading with Deep Learning: From Word Embeddings to Transformers, (2022); MacDonald C., Rose E., Putnam C., An industry in flux: Where does UX go from here, Interactions, 29, pp. 54-58, (2022); Oleson A., Solomon M., Ko A., Computing Students' Learning Difficulties in HCI Education, pp. 1-14, (2020); ChatGPT, (2023); Rietz T., Maedche A., Cody: An AI-Based System to Semi-Automate Coding for Qualitative Research, Proceedings of the 2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (Yokohama, Japan) (CHI '21), (2021); Wang X., Fan S., Houghton J., Wang L., Towards Process-Oriented, Modular, and Versatile Question Generation that Meets Educational Needs, Proceedings of the 2022 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pp. 291-302, (2022); Weegar R., Idestam-Almquist P., ReducingWorkload in Short Answer Grading Using Machine Learning, International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education; Zesch T., Horbach A., ESCRITO-An NLP-Enhanced Educational Scoring Toolkit, Proceedings of the Eleventh International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2018), (2018)",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",ACM,"10th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale, L@S 2023",20 July 2023 through 22 July 2023,Copenhagen,190884.0,,979-840070025-5,,,English,L@S - Proc.

Detecting Learners' Hint Inquiry Behaviors in e-Learning Environment by using Facial Expressions,2023,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"It is difficult for teachers to track how each student is engaged in a class through e-learning. The current study simulated an e-learning environment by designing a website which contains interactable functions and hint buttons to examine whether the mental state of hint seeking can be estimated from facial features. We currently recruited 9 participants and asked them to solve a problem used in the International Olympiad of Linguistics in 2018. In this study, participants learned alone without discussing with others on a website designed for the experiment. While they were solving the problems, their face images were recorded. We extracted their facial features as Action Unit codes (AUs) by an open-source software, OpenFace. There was a function that provided hints to participants when he or she clicked a button. We attempted to estimate the time to click the button, that is the time when a hint was required, from facial expressions using a machine learning technique. We used LightGBM for the prediction. The model trained by LightGBM classified the state of ""seeking hints""and the other states with an accuracy of 85.0%. The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values, which are indexes of contribution levels, showed that facial features of ""brow lowerer"", ""lip tightener"", and ""jaw drop""are the top three important features for the classification.

Developing a Prototype to Scale up Digital Support for Online Assessment Design,2023,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"Educators rarely have access to just-in-time feedback and guiding heuristics when designing or updating assessments in higher education. This study describes the initial development process for an automated support system for designing high-quality online assessments. We identify key elements to embed in this digital artifact to offer just-in-time support for educators to design and evaluate their online assessments. We follow a design science approach in six stages, because it simultaneously generates knowledge about the method used to develop the artifact and the design of the artifact itself. Specifically, we focus on the early stages of problem identification, solution objectives, and initial conceptual design. After reviewing multiple assessment models and frameworks, we discuss a recent framework for evaluating and designing high-quality online assessments, consisting of ten design and contextual elements. This framework underpins the proposed solution which is a digital artifact that encourages consideration of alternate forms of assessment while retaining the flexibility to operate within individual educators' design practices and contexts. We expect the proposed system to help educators and instructional designers to better understand the strengths and weaknesses of their assessments, consider alternate forms of assessment, and incorporate the system into their assessment design process. © 2023 ACM.",,,,,,100,Developing a Prototype to Scale up Digital Support for Online Assessment Design,Cram A.; Raduescu C.; Zeivots S.; Smolansky A.; Kizilcec R.F.; Huber E.,"Cram, Andrew (55317187400); Raduescu, Corina (55485064900); Zeivots, Sandris (57194089447); Smolansky, Adele (58490326800); Kizilcec, René F.

"Digital Access, Usage, and Educational Outcomes: Evidence from Vietnam",2023,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"The arrival and development of digital technologies (e.g. the internet, personal computer) including mobile ones (e.g. smartphones) in recent years have raised both support for and concerns about the effects of adoption and usage on learning outcomes. The arguments come from different educational stakeholders including parents, educators, practitioners, policy makers, and learners themselves. On the one hand, those in favor argue for increasing opportunities to learn (OtL) or seamless learning thanks to the mobility and multifunctionality of mobile internet devices. On the other hand, those against attest to multitasking, task switching, and rising social media or entertainment addiction phenomena as detrimental. With evidence from Vietnam, this paper contributes to the scant literature of net effect of digital devices use, and identified insignificant effect of smartphone use on Math and reading comprehension test scores while positive results of internet and computer access, using linear regressions and Lewbel instrumental variable methods. The results can be explained by the significantly positive effects of internet use for exam samples searching while negative effect of internet use for social networking, which is one among many online platforms competing for attention in the attention economy era. Our results shed light on the intricacy of mobile internet use's effects for upper-secondary school students' key learning outcomes, and offer some recommendations for educational practitioners. © 2023 ACM.",,,,,,100,"Digital Access, Usage, and Educational Outcomes: Evidence from Vietnam",Pham T.T.,"Pham, Trang Thi (58535520500)",58535520500,"Digital Access, Usage, and Educational Outcomes: Evidence from Vietnam",2023.0,L@S 2023 - Proceedings of the 10th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,267,271,4.0,0.0,10.1145/3573051.3596169,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85167865213&doi=10.1145%2f3573051.3596169&partnerID=40&md5=c2c5849720f76e1d63ecb45c4602e853,"UNU-MERIT, Maastricht University, Limburg, Maastricht, Netherlands","Pham T.T., UNU-MERIT, Maastricht University, Limburg, Maastricht, Netherlands",adolescents; cognitive skills; computers; digital access; digital ecosystem; digital use types; educational achievements; informal learning; internet; math; reading comprehension; secondary school; smartphones; ubiquitous technology,Digital devices; E-learning; Personal computers; Social networking (online); Social sciences computing; Students; Adolescent; Cognitive skill; Digital access; Digital ecosystem; Digital use type; Educational achievement; Informal learning; Math; Reading comprehension; Secondary schools; Smart phones; Ubiquitous technology; Smartphones,,,,,,,"Amez S., Baert S., Smartphone use and academic performance: A literature review, Int J Educ Res, 103, (2020); Vietnam-Mobile Apps, (2018); Azubuike O., Little A., Learning motivations, learning outcomes and gender in Vietnam, Young Lives, (2019); Baum C.F., Lewbel A., Schaffer M.E., Talavera O., Instrumental variables estimation using heteroskedasticity-based instruments, (2012); Behrman J.R., Parental Investments and Children's Human Capital in Low-to-Middle-Income Countries, (2022); Bernacki M.L., Greene J.A., Crompton H., Mobile technology, learning, and achievement: Advances in understanding and measuring the role of mobile technology in education, Contemp Educ Psychol, 60, (2020); Buchi M., Just N., Latzer M., Modeling the second-level digital divide: A five-country study of social differences in Internet use, New Media Soc, 18, 11, pp. 2703-2722, (2016); Chen M., The Impact of Mobile Learning on the Effectiveness of English Teaching and Learning-A Meta-Analysis, IEEE Access, 10, pp. 38324-38334, (2022); Cueto S., Felipe C., Leon J., Digital Access, Use and Skills Across Four Countries: Construction of Scales and Preliminary Results from the Young Lives Round 5 Survey, (2018); Deuflhard F., Georgarakos D., Inderst R., Financial Literacy and Savings Account Returns, J Eur Econ Assoc, 17, 1, pp. 131-164, (2019); Van Deursen A.J.A.M., Van Dijk J.A.G.M., The digital divide shifts to differences in usage, New Media Soc, 16, 3, pp. 507-526, (2014); Felisoni D.D., Go A.S., Cell phone usage and academic performance: An experiment, Comput Educ, 117, pp. 175-187, (2018); Fey J.T., Technology and mathematics education: A survey of recent developments and important problems, Educational Studies in Mathematics, 20, 3, pp. 237-272, (1989); Gulati S., Technology-Enhanced Learning in Developing Nations: A review, The International Review of Research in Open and Distributed Learning, 9, 1, (2008); Hendricks V.F., The Nuts and Bolts of Attention Economy, (2022); Lin Y., Liu Y., Fan W., Tuunainen V.K., Deng S., Revisiting the relationship between smartphone use and academic performance: A large-scale study, Comput Human Behav, 122, (2021); Manca S., Ranieri M., Is it a tool suitable for learning.

Does STEM Success Start Young? Exploring Higher Ed Students' Early Academic Experiences in Science and Math at Scale,2023,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"The United States is experiencing a shortage of STEM workers [24], with many students leaving the pipeline before attaining a career in STEM [18]. STEM education researchers have identified factors at the high school and college level that contribute to attrition, but earlier life events remain underexplored [14]. In this work-in-progress paper, we examine childhood experiences through the lens of qualitative analyses and discuss our ongoing development of an overall understanding of the relevant life and academic ""themes""that shape students' lives before entering secondary school. We are currently testing our seven-theme model on the OpenStax Kinetic large-scale research infrastructure using quantitative surveys of participants' biographical data. Our findings from this study will inform future refinement of the survey and its themes, with a particular emphasis on understanding the influence of contextual demographic and psychosocial factors. Over the longer-term, we hope to support research that identifies critical early STEM experiences and offers insight into where certain students might benefit the most from additional STEM support or experiences. © 2023 ACM.",,,,,,100,Does STEM Success Start Young?

Does the Availability of Reattempts and Video Solutions Affect Learners' Voluntary Engagement with Mastery Learning Activities?  421-425,2023,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"Designing interactive virtual learning environments with effective and engaging design elements is crucial in enhancing learners' motivation, engagement, and learning outcomes. By prioritizing a positive user experience that curates cognitive load, interactions within virtual learning environments may effectively promote voluntary and formative engagement. This analysis focuses on investigating the affordances of having an opportunity to immediately reattempt an incorrectly answered question and additionally have access to video solutions on students' voluntary engagement with mastery learning activities. These mastery learning activities were provided in the form of quizzes through a virtual learning environment, YANTRA EDU. This application was developed to facilitate mastery learning, where learners have the opportunity to engage with the sequential practice of various concepts in an introductory programming (CS1) course. The paper describes the design of YANTRA EDU and presents a comparative study of two design conditions, examining the variations in student interactions between the two conditions. The study is based on the availability of reattempts and video-based scaffolding as key differentiating factors in the two conditions. In the first condition (NoRV), the questions did not have an immediate reattempt option if an answer was incorrect. It also did not have any video-based solution available to the students. In the second condition (YesRV), students were provided with one reattempt opportunity if an answer was incorrect. And if the second reattempt response was incorrect, they were provided a video that included a step-by-step explanation of the question's correct approach and solution. In both conditions, the questions would randomly repeat after all the unique questions were attempted to provide continuous practice. We analyze and compare students' aggregate voluntary usage of the practice quizzes between the two conditions. We find that although there were no statistically significant differences in the number of attempted questions and the number of questions correctly answered in the two conditions, students exhibited statistically significant higher accuracy rates with the NoRV condition, where they did not have the option to reattempt or receive video solutions. These results contribute to the understanding of how different interaction design components may influence learners' voluntary engagement within virtual learning environments. © 2023 ACM.",,,,,,97,Does the Availability of Reattempts and Video Solutions Affect Learners' Voluntary Engagement with Mastery Learning Activities?,Aggarwal A.; Pitts G.; Marusic S.; Harvey L.; Gardner-Mccune C.,"Aggarwal, Ashish (57189295761); Pitts, Griffin (58535433400); Marusic, Shayne (58535476700); Harvey, Leslie (57219309572); Gardner-Mccune, Christina (55858392400)",57189295761; 58535433400; 58535476700; 57219309572; 55858392400,Does the Availability of Reattempts and Video Solutions Affect Learners' Voluntary Engagement with Mastery Learning Activities?,2023.0,L@S 2023 - Proceedings of the 10th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,421,425,4.0,0.0,10.1145/3573051.3596201,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85167871654&doi=10.1145%2f3573051.3596201&partnerID=40&md5=c81d117d17b817d7684252924805e38a,"University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, United States","Aggarwal A., University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, United States; Pitts G., University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, United States; Marusic S., University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, United States; Harvey L., University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, United States; Gardner-Mccune C., University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, United States",CS1; design; formative; interaction; mastery learning; optional practice; reattempts; video-based-scaffolding; virtual learning environment; voluntary engagement,Computer aided instruction; Design; E-learning; Scaffolds; Condition; Formative; Interaction; Mastery learning; Optional practice; Reattempt; Video solutions; Video-based-scaffolding; Virtual learning environments; Voluntary engagement; Students,,,,,,,"Cao J., Crews J.M., Lin M., Burgoon J.K., Nunamaker J.F., An Empirical Investigation of Virtual Interaction in Supporting Learning, SIGMIS Database, 39, 3, pp. 51-68, (2008); Czerkawski B.C., Lyman E.W., An instructional design framework for fostering student engagement in online learning environments, TechTrends, 60, pp. 532-539, (2016); Davis D., Seaton D., Hauff C., Houben G., Toward Large-Scale Learning Design: Categorizing Course Designs in Service of Supporting Learning Outcomes, Proceedings of the Fifth Annual ACM Conference on Learning at Scale (London, United Kingdom) (L@S '18), (2018); Garcia D., McMahon C., Garcia Y., West M., Zilles C., Achieving""A's for All (as Time and Interest Allow), Proceedings of the Ninth ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale (New York City, NY, USA) (L@S '22), pp. 255-258, (2022); Jiang X., Rollinson J., Plonsky L., Gustafson E., Pajak B., Evaluating the reading and listening outcomes of beginning-level Duolingo courses, Foreign Language Annals, 54, 4, pp. 974-1002, (2021); Koedinger K.R., McLaughlin E.A., Jia J.Z., Bier N.L., Is the Doer Effect a Causal Relationship How Can We Tell and Why It's Important, Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Learning Analytics amp; Knowledge (Edinburgh, United Kingdom) (LAK '16), pp. 388-397, (2016); Kross S., Guo P.J., Students, Systems, and Interactions: Synthesizing the First Four Years of Learning@scale and Charting the Future, Proceedings of the Fifth Annual ACM Conference on Learning at Scale (London, United Kingdom) (L@S '18), (2018); Kulkarni C., Design Perspectives of Learning at Scale: Scaling Efficiency and Empowerment, Proceedings of the Sixth(2019) ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale (Chicago, IL, USA) (L@S '19), (2019); Liu Y., Yu F., Supporting active learning and formative evaluation via teaching-by-questioning in classrooms: Design, development, and preliminary evaluation of an online learning system, Interactive Learning Environments, 27, 5-6, pp. 841-855, (2019); Mishra S., A design framework for online learning environments, British Journal of Educational Technology, 33, 4, pp. 493-496, (2002); Razzaq L., Heffernan N.T., Scaffolding vs.hints in the Assistment System, Intelligent Tutoring Systems: 8th International Conference, ITS 2006, pp. 635-644, (2006); Ritter S., Yudelson M., Fancsali S.E., Berman S.R., How Mastery Learning Works at Scale, Proceedings of the Third(2016) ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale (Edinburgh, Scotland, UK) (L@S '16), pp. 71-79, (2016); Roschelle J., Feng M., Murphy R.F., Mason C.A., Online mathematics homework increases student achievement, AERA open, 2, 4, (2016); Saade R.G., Morin D., Jennifer D.E.T., Critical thinking in E-learning environments, Computers in Human Behavior, 28, 5, pp. 1608-1617, (2012); Tondello G.F., An Introduction to Gamification in Human-Computer Interaction, XRDS, 23, 1, pp. 15-17, (2016)",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",ACM,"10th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale, L@S 2023",20 July 2023 through 22 July 2023,Copenhagen,190884.0,,979-840070025-5,,,English,L@S - Proc.

Educator and Student Perspectives on the Impact of Generative AI on Assessments in Higher Education,2023,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"The sudden popularity and availability of generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT that can write compelling essays on any topic, code in various programming languages, and ace standardized tests across domains, raises questions about the sustainability of traditional assessment practices. To seize this opportunity for innovation in assessment practice, we conducted a survey to understand both the educators' and students' perspectives on the issue. We measure and compare attitudes of both stakeholders across various assessment scenarios, building on an established framework for examining the quality of online assessments along six dimensions. Responses from 389 students and 36 educators across two universities indicate moderate usage of generative AI, consensus for which types of assessments are most impacted, and concerns about academic integrity. Educators prefer adapted assessments that assume AI will be used and encourage critical thinking, but students' reaction is mixed, in part due to concerns about a loss of creativity. The findings show the importance of engaging educators and students in assessment reform efforts to focus on the process of learning over its outputs, higher-order thinking, and authentic applications. © 2023 ACM.",,,,,,100,Educator and Student Perspectives on the Impact of Generative AI on Assessments in Higher Education,Smolansky A.; Cram A.; Raduescu C.; Zeivots S.; Huber E.; Kizilcec R.F.,"Smolansky, Adele (58490326800); Cram, Andrew (55317187400); Raduescu, Corina (55485064900); Zeivots, Sandris (57194089447); Huber, Elaine (55095172000); Kizilcec, Rene F.

Effects of Scaling Up Apprentice-Style Research: Perceptions from Mentors and Mentees,2023,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"Access to undergraduate research is limited. One approach to broaden access is scaling up the mentee-to-mentor ratio (e.g., course-based undergraduate research experiences have a classroom of student mentees being led by one professor mentor). However, some mentors and mentees may prefer apprentice-style research, which is defined as research with a small mentee-to-mentor ratio. Pulling influences from non-scaled and scaled approaches, we implemented and evaluated the Community College to PhD (CC2PhD) Scholars Program, which was a community college research program. CC2PhD was designed to scale up non-personalized aspects of apprentice-style research while maintaining personalized one-on-one mentoring. The scaled non-personalized aspects of CC2PhD included the predefined mentoring curriculum and the research methods workshops. They were ""scaled""in the sense that few people were involved in curriculum development and workshop instruction. These scaled resources can then be used by a large number of mentor-mentee pairs. We interviewed and surveyed seven mentor alumni and six mentee alumni to understand the effects of the scaled aspects of CC2PhD. We identified four themes: (1) improved time-related issues by saving time and facilitating time management, (2) influenced meeting content, (3) helped beginner mentors and mentees, and (4) increased mentors' willingness to volunteer. Future researchers can further scale-up and digitize our scaled research-apprentice model. For example, the mentoring curriculum and workshops can be adapted into a MOOC, which mentor-mentee pairs can reference from. © 2023 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,Effects of Scaling Up Apprentice-Style Research: Perceptions from Mentors and Mentees,Nguyen D.V.; Epstein D.A.; Doroudi S.,"Nguyen, David Van (58497228100); Epstein, Daniel A.

Efficient Transformer-based Knowledge Tracing for a Personalized Language Education Application,2023,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"The purpose of this paper is to propose a new deep learning-based approach to recommend highly personalized educational contents to learners. Towards this goal, we present a knowledge tracing algorithm by adding long short-term memory units to a Transformer-based model. By inferring the knowledge state of a learner through the proposed KT algorithm, it not only removes problems that the learner does not have to solve but also suggest problems so that the learner's knowledge state level improves most efficiently. In this manner, a personalized educational curriculum can be provided to each learner. We trained the model with 90 million datasets collected from a Hangeul (i.e., Korean character) learning mobile application called ""Sojung-Hangeul"", one of the market-leading Korean learning services. The experimental results show that the AUC of the proposed model significantly improves from 0.88 to 0.92 compared to the recent Transformer-based approach in real-time environments.

Encouraging Critical Thinking Support System: Question Generation and Lecture Slide Recommendations,2023,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"In recent years, online learning has gained popularity in Japan, increasing opportunities for remote study using lecture slides. However, a common issue in Japanese education is that students tend to not ask questions in class. To address this issue, we propose an online learning support system informed by research on ""critical thinking""that facilitates the process of students' questioning and thinking. In this study, we aimed to clarify the relationship between the questions generated by students and the class slides. We did this by analyzing the hierarchical relationship of the keywords that appear in the slides. We also propose a method of recommending appropriate lecture slides for the questions that we hope will encourage students to ask meaningful questions and engage in productive discussions. © 2023 ACM.",,,,,,100,Encouraging Critical Thinking Support System: Question Generation and Lecture Slide Recommendations,Inoue S.; Wang Y.; Kawai Y.; Sumiya K.,"Inoue, Saki (58034841800); Wang, Yuanyuan (56242936500); Kawai, Yukiko (8902658900); Sumiya, Kazutoshi (15064676800)",58034841800; 56242936500; 8902658900; 15064676800,Encouraging Critical Thinking Support System: Question Generation and Lecture Slide Recommendations,2023.0,L@S 2023 - Proceedings of the 10th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,287,291,4.0,0.0,10.1145/3573051.3596173,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85167867505&doi=10.1145%2f3573051.3596173&partnerID=40&md5=a5064af18ab8c34bd2552258362f46ca,"Kwansei Gakuin University, Sanda, Japan; Yamaguchi University, Ube, Japan; Kyoto Sangyo University, Kyoto, Japan","Inoue S., Kwansei Gakuin University, Sanda, Japan; Wang Y., Yamaguchi University, Ube, Japan; Kawai Y., Kyoto Sangyo University, Kyoto, Japan; Sumiya K., Kwansei Gakuin University, Sanda, Japan",critical thinking; e-learning; lecture slide recommendation; online learning support; question generation,E-learning; Learning systems; Critical thinking; E - learning; Japanese educations; Learning support; Lecture slide recommendation; Lecture slides; Online learning; Online learning support; Question generation; Support systems; Students,,,,,,,"King A., Designing the instructional process to enhance critical thinking across the curriculum: Inquiring minds really do want to know: Using questioning to teach critical thinking, Teaching of Psychology, 22, 1, pp. 13-17, (1995); Ikuta J., Maruno S., Does the child generate a question in elementary school class : Relation between interrogative feeling and the question generation, and expression, Psychological Research of Kyushu University, 5, pp. 9-18, (2004); Inoue S., Wang Y., Kawai Y., Sumiya K., Question support method to promote critical thinking using lecture slide structure in on-demand courses, pp. 509-515, (2022); King A., Facilitating elaborative learning through guided student-generated questioning, Educational Psychologist, 27, 1, pp. 111-126, (1992); Ikuta J., Maruno S., Change of children' questioning in elementary school class through question-generating centered instruction, Japan Journal of Educational Technology, 29, 4, pp. 577-586, (2006); Shinogaya K., An examination of the impact of interventions in question generation and answer generation during preparatory activities on class comprehension and its process [in Japanese], Educational Psychology Research, 61, 4, pp. 351-361, (2013); Johnson B.G., Dittel J.S., Van Campenhout R., Jerome B., Discrimination of automatically generated questions used as formative practice, Proceedings of the Ninth ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale, L@S '22, pp. 325-329, (2022); Prihar E., Haim A., Sales A., Heffernan N., Automatic interpretable personalized learning, Proceedings of the Ninth ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale, L@S '22, pp. 1-11, (2022)",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",ACM,"10th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale, L@S 2023",20 July 2023 through 22 July 2023,Copenhagen,190884.0,,979-840070025-5,,,English,L@S - Proc.

Envisioning an Inclusive Metaverse: Student Perspectives on Accessible and Empowering Metaverse-Enabled Learning,2023,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"The emergence of the metaverse is being widely viewed as a revolutionary technology owing to a myriad of factors, particularly the potential to increase the accessibility of learning for students with disabilities. However, not much is yet known about the views and expectations of disabled students in this regard. The fact that the metaverse is still in its nascent stage exemplifies the need for such timely discourse. To bridge this important gap, we conducted a series of semi-structured interviews with 56 university students with disabilities in the United States and Hong Kong to understand their views and expectations concerning the future of metaverse-driven education. We have distilled student expectations into five thematic categories, referred to as the REEPS framework: Recognition, Empowerment, Engagement, Privacy, and Safety. Additionally, we have summarized the main design considerations in eight concise points. This paper is aimed at helping technology developers and policymakers plan ahead of time and improving the experiences of students with disabilities. © 2023 ACM.",,,,,,100,Envisioning an Inclusive Metaverse: Student Perspectives on Accessible and Empowering Metaverse-Enabled Learning,Hadi Mogavi R.; Hoffman J.; Deng C.; Du Y.; Haq E.-U.; Hui P.,"Hadi Mogavi, Reza (57223128215); Hoffman, Jennifer (58113207800); Deng, Chao (58112267500); Du, Yiwei (58341753300); Haq, Ehsan-Ul (57205283169); Hui, Pan (14029922900)",57223128215; 58113207800; 58112267500; 58341753300; 57205283169; 14029922900,Envisioning an Inclusive Metaverse: Student Perspectives on Accessible and Empowering Metaverse-Enabled Learning,2023.0,L@S 2023 - Proceedings of the 10th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,346,353,7.0,0.0,10.1145/3573051.3596185,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85167873931&doi=10.1145%2f3573051.3596185&partnerID=40&md5=1e8342d1e011b4ccba29564f6f85a0a9,"HKUST, Hong Kong; University of Waterloo, Canada; Accessible Meta Group; Dalian University of Technology, China; Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), Hong Kong","Hadi Mogavi R., HKUST, Hong Kong, University of Waterloo, Canada; Hoffman J., Accessible Meta Group; Deng C., Accessible Meta Group; Du Y., Dalian University of Technology, China; Haq E.-U., Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), Hong Kong; Hui P., Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), Hong Kong",accessibility; disabled students; emerging technologies; higher education; inclusion; interview study; metaverse,Accessibility; Disabled students; Emerging technologies; High educations; Interview study; Metaverses; Revolutionary technology; Semi structured interviews; Student perspectives; University students; Students,,,,,"MetaHKUST; Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, HKUST","The authors gratefully acknowledge the support, in part, from the MetaHKUST project at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) for this research.","Agarawala A., Spatial: Metaverse Spaces That Bring Us Together, (2016); Blandford A., Furniss D., Makri S., Qualitative HCI research: Going behind the scenes, Synthesis lectures on human-centered informatics, 9, 1, pp. 1-115, (2016); Borget S., Sandbox: The third-largest metaverse based on the Ethereum blockchain, (2012); Carroll P., Tavakoli R., Bloktopia: A Metaverse Platform Designed as a Skyscraper, (2021); Choi D., Lee U., Hong H., It's Not Wrong, but I'm Quite Disappointed"": Toward an Inclusive Algorithmic Experience for Content Creators with Disabilities, Proceedings of the 2022 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (New Orleans, LA, USA) (CHI '22), (2022); Roblox: A 3D Game Platform and Game Creation System, (2004); D'Agostino S., College in the Metaverse Is Here, Is Higher Ed Ready, (2022); Duan H., Li J., Fan S., Lin Z., Wu X., Cai W., Metaverse for Social Good: A University Campus Prototype, Proceedings of the 29th ACM International Conference on Multimedia (Virtual Event, China) (MM '21), pp. 153-161, (2021); Decentraland: An Immersive Metaverse with the Concept of Dual-tokenomics, (2015); Freeman G., Maloney D., Acena D., Barwulor C., Re)Discovering the Physical Body Online: Strategies and Challenges to Approach Non-Cisgender Identity in Social Virtual Reality, Proceedings of the 2022 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (New Orleans, LA, USA) (CHI '22), (2022); Gavin H., Understanding research methods and statistics in psychology, Sage, (2008); Gaylor G., VRChat: An Online Virtual World Platform for Games and Socialization, (2014); Gupta M., Abdolrahmani A., Edwards E., Cortez M., Tumang A., Majali Y., Lazaga M., Tarra S., Patil P., Kuber R., Branham S.M., Towards More Universal Wayfinding Technologies: Navigation Preferences Across Disabilities, Proceedings of the 2020 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (Honolulu, HI, USA) (CHI '20), pp. 1-13, (2020); Mogavi R.H., Guo B., Zhang Y., Haq E., Hui P., Ma X., When Gamification Spoils Your Learning: A Qualitative Case Study of Gamification Misuse in a Language-Learning App, pp. 175-188, (2022); Mogavi R.H., Ma X., Hui P., Characterizing Student Engagement Moods for Dropout Prediction in Question Pool Websites, Proc.

How Civil are Comments on TikTok's Educational Videos? Insights for Learning at Scale,2023,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"Social networking sites present opportunities for informal learning at scale. Researchers have explored the use of TikTok, a site for sharing short-formed videos, for informal and formal learning. As we consider the learning potential of sites like TikTok, it is equally important to investigate features that may discourage learning. Our work examines the pervasiveness of incivility, or offensive language targeting individuals and ideas, in videos categorized with educational hashtags on TikTok. We collect a corpus of 346,626 TikTok comments, and find a small percentage (1.5%) with uncivil content that might turn someone away from the discussion. To understand participation patterns, we compare comment threads in videos with the highest average incivility to the rest of the corpus. These comment threads generally have earlier appearance of uncivil content, lower participation from video creators, and less unique participation from different users. Findings have implications for content moderation in online discussions, to deprioritize uncivil content and encourage facilitation from content creators. © 2023 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,How Civil are Comments on TikTok's Educational Videos?

Increasing Available Attempts: Changes in Student Correctness on Formative Introductory Physics Problems,2023,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"Student submission data from formative graded physics problems were analyzed to detect effects from increasing the number of available attempts. The problems were used in two subsequent runs of MIT's general requirement introductory electricity and magnetism course, 8.02, with 190 students in the 2021 course and 203 in the 2022 course. Students completed the problems asynchronously in interactive online lessons as part of a blended learning design. The problems awarded full credit on any attempt and gave correctness as submission feedback. A number of available attempts was set for each problem by the course designers, varying across problems. Between 2021 and 2022, this number was increased for some problems but not others, creating a natural experiment. Qualitative effects were evaluated relative to a control group of unmodified problems and were found to differ between constructed response and selected response problems. Constructed response problems saw a significant decrease in first-attempt success rate and increase in rate of abandoning with attempts remaining, despite an insignificant increase in overall success rate. Selected response problems saw a significant increase in overall success but negligible changes in first-attempt success and abandoning. For both types, there was a significant increase in the overall number of attempts used. These results suggest that increasing attempts for constructed and selected response problems may encourage undesirable approaches to answering the problems, even in a formative context. © 2023 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,Increasing Available Attempts: Changes in Student Correctness on Formative Introductory Physics Problems,Macdonagh A.,"Macdonagh, Aidan (58535475900)",58535475900,Increasing Available Attempts: Changes in Student Correctness on Formative Introductory Physics Problems,2023.0,L@S 2023 - Proceedings of the 10th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,426,430,4.0,0.0,10.1145/3573051.3596202,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85167865216&doi=10.1145%2f3573051.3596202&partnerID=40&md5=086facf4aba6b38d5db83431138cb039,"Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States","Macdonagh A., Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States",blended learning; constructed and selected response; formative assessment; introductory physics; multiple attempts; online problems,E-learning; Blended learning; Constructed and selected response; Control groups; Formative assessment; Introductory physic; Learning designs; Multiple attempt; Natural experiment; Online problems; Students,,,,,,,"Aiken L.S., West S.G., Reno R.R., Multiple Regression: Testing and Interpreting Interactions, Sage Publications, pp. 38-46, (1991); Alexandron G., Wiltrout M.E., Berg A., Ruiperez-Valiente J.A., Assessment That Matters: Balancing Reliability and Learner-Centered Pedagogy in MOOC Assessment, Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Learning Analytics and Knowledge (Frankfurt, Germany) (LAK '20), pp. 512-517, (2020); Attali Y., Effects of multiple-try feedback and question type during mathematics problem solving on performance in similar problems, Computers and Education, 86, pp. 260-267, (2015); Attali Y., Powers D., Immediate Feedback and Opportunity to Revise Answers to Open-Ended Questions, Educational and Psychological Measurement, 70, 1, pp. 22-35, (2009); Bonham S., Beichner R., Deardorff D., Online homework: Does it make a difference, The Physics Teacher, 39, (2001); Dori Y.J., Belcher J., How Does Technology-Enabled Active Learning Affect Undergraduate Students' Understanding of Electromagnetism Concepts, Journal of the Learning Sciences, 14, 2, pp. 243-279, (2005); Dourmashkin P., Tomasik M., Rayyan S., The TEAL Physics Project at MIT, pp. 499-520, (2020); Kortemeyer G., An empirical study of the effect of granting multiple tries for online homework, American Journal of Physics, 83, (2015); Magalhaes P., Ferreira D., Cunha J., Rosario P., Online vs traditional homework: A systematic review on the benefits to students' performance, Computers and Education, 152, (2020); Nicol D.J., Macfarlane-Dick D., Formative assessment and self-regulated learning: A model and seven principles of good feedback practice, Studies in Higher Education, 31, 2, pp. 199-218, (2006); NIST/SEMATECH e-Handbook of Statistical Methods, (2012); Rhodes M.T., Sarbaum J.K., Online Homework Management Systems: Should We Allow Multiple Attempts, American Economist, 60, 2, pp. 120-131, (2015); Zhang S., Bergner Y., DiTrapani J., Jeon M., Modeling the interaction between resilience and ability in assessments with allowances for multiple attempts, Computers in Human Behavior, 122, (2021)","A.

Innovating at Campus Scale: The Case of Michigan's Atlas,2023,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"In 2016, a curricular information service was launched on the main campus of the University of Michigan. Through course guide entry links, students could view five-year historical summaries of various course properties. In subsequent years, the service expanded to share more elements of the academic landscape, including recent information on instructors and degrees. Rebranded as Atlas and positioned as an aid to improving academic decisions, this local campus innovation has scaled to be used by 99% of undergraduate students, with more than 54,000 unique users in calendar year 2022. A schedule builder feature and the ability to create and share collections have driven user growth and offer unique research windows into student academic preferences and decisions. As Atlas pivots from sharing passive historical views to more actively guiding students' academic pathways, the faculty and staff team behind the service continue to experiment with community building, translational research, and maintaining innovation at scale. Here, we review the growth and evolution of the service and share the experience of innovating at scale at a major American research university. © 2023 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,Innovating at Campus Scale: The Case of Michigan's Atlas,Evrard A.E.; Matz R.; Murray E.; Hayward B.; Mills M.; Hayward C.,"Evrard, August E.

Leveraging Human Feedback to Scale Educational Datasets: Combining Crowdworkers and Comparative Judgement,2023,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"Machine Learning models have many potentially beneficial applications in education settings, but a key barrier to their development is securing enough high-quality, labelled data to train these models. This process has traditionally relied on highly skilled raters using complex, multi-class rubrics, which made labelling expensive and difficult to scale. A more scalable approach would be to use non-expert crowdworkers to evaluate student work, but maintaining high levels of accuracy and inter-rater reliability when using non-expert workers can be challenging. This paper reports on two experiments in which non-expert crowdworkers hired to evaluate (i.e., score) student work and were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: the control, where they were asked to assign a rubrics based score (i.e., a categorical judgement), or the treatment, where they were shown the same student answers, but were asked to decide which of two candidate answers was better (i.e., a comparative/preference-based judgement). We found that using comparative judgement substantially improved inter-rater reliability on both tasks. These results are in-line with well-established literature on the benefits of comparative judgement in the field of educational assessment, as well as with recent trends in artificial intelligence research, where comparative judgement is becoming the preferred method for providing human feedback on model outputs. These results are novel and important in demonstrating the effects of using the combination of comparative judgement and crowdworkers to evaluate educational data © 2023 ACM.",,,,,,100,Leveraging Human Feedback to Scale Educational Datasets: Combining Crowdworkers and Comparative Judgement,Henkel O.; Hills L.,"Henkel, Owen (58345634000); Hills, Libby (58343704000)",58345634000; 58343704000,Leveraging Human Feedback to Scale Educational Datasets: Combining Crowdworkers and Comparative Judgement,2023.0,L@S 2023 - Proceedings of the 10th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,411,415,4.0,0.0,10.1145/3573051.3596198,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85167867458&doi=10.1145%2f3573051.3596198&partnerID=40&md5=1bf610f74283349643259fe3c24fac6a,"Department of Education, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom; Jacobs Foundation, Zurich, Switzerland","Henkel O., Department of Education, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom; Hills L., Jacobs Foundation, Zurich, Switzerland",comparative judgement; crowdworkers; human feedback,Education computing; Students; Application in education; Comparative judgment; Crowdworker; High quality; Human feedback; Interrater reliability; Labeled data; Labelings; Machine learning models; Scalable approach; Feedback,,,,,,,"Baker R.S., Artificial intelligence in education: Bringing it all together, Digital education outlook: Pushing the frontiers with AI, blockchain, and robots, pp. 43-54; Wilson J., Pollard B., Aiken J.M., Caballero M.D., Lewandowski H.J., Classification of open-ended responses to a research-based assessment using natural language processing, Physical Review Physics Education Research, 18, (2022); Belur J., Tompson L., Thornton A., Simon M., Interrater Reliability in Systematic Review Methodology: Exploring Variation in Coder Decision-Making, Sociological Methods & Research, 50, 2, pp. 837-865, (2021); Daniel F., Kucherbaev P., Cappiello C., Benatallah B., Allahbakhsh M., Quality Control in Crowdsourcing, ACM Computing Surveys, 51, 1, pp. 1-40, (2018); Wortman V.J., Making Better Use of the Crowd: How Crowdsourcing Can Advance Machine Learning Re-search, J.

Managing the Chaos: Approaches to Navigating Discussion Forums for Instructional Staff,2023,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"As enrollment increases, teaching assistants (TAs) need help prioritizing responding to students' posts in on-line forums. In a graduate-level Artificial Intelligence forum, three instructors rank the urgency of posts which is compared to the ratings of 13 course TAs; correlation with the instructors' scores have an r=0.55, with a TA inter-rater reliability of 35%. However, when TAs used a codebook containing seven dimensions created by the instructors to define urgency levels, correlation increased to r=0.73 and reliability to 53%. The instructor rankings are also compared to cognitive presence ratings from the Community of Inquiry framework. Cognitive presence correlates with urgency with r=-0.68. These results suggest that recommendation agents that prioritize posts based on cognitive presence or the urgency codebook may be beneficial for TAs. © 2023 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,Managing the Chaos: Approaches to Navigating Discussion Forums for Instructional Staff,Irish I.;

No Benefit for High-Dosage Time Management Interventions in Online Courses,2023,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"In past work, time management interventions involving prompts, alerts, and planning tools have successfully nudged students in online courses, leading to higher engagement and improved performance. However, few studies have investigated the effectiveness of these interventions over time, understanding if the effectiveness maintains or changes based on dosage (i.e., how often an intervention is provided). In the current study, we conducted a randomized controlled trial to test if the effect of a time management intervention changes over repeated use. Students at an online computer science course were randomly assigned to receive interventions based on two schedules (i.e., high-dosage vs. low-dosage). We ran a two-way mixed ANOVA, comparing students' assignment start time and performance across several weeks. Unexpectedly, we did not find a significant main effect from the use of the intervention, nor was there an interaction effect between the use of the intervention and week of the course. © 2023 ACM.",,,,,,100,No Benefit for High-Dosage Time Management Interventions in Online Courses,Zhang J.; Baker R.S.; Farmer T.,"Zhang, Jiayi (57412785700); Baker, Ryan S.

On Air: Benefits of weekly Podcasts accompanying Online Courses,2023,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"Podcasts are a widely-used medium for communication and learning. One advantage of them is the possibility to pursue other activities while listening. Contrasting, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) employ video-based teaching methods. Current research, however, challenges the interactivity and variation of teaching content in established MOOCs. This manuscript presents an experiment conducted with a podcast series deployed alongside a MOOC on cybersecurity. In our Static-Group Comparison, we identified a significant increase in learning success in weekly graded exercises (6.3%) and the course's final examination (6.4%) for learners exposing themselves to the podcast. Our first study results are promising in favor of multimedia learning. Hence, we present ideas for additional analysis and briefly outline which aspects of the results should be discussed in more depth. © 2023 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,On Air: Benefits of weekly Podcasts accompanying Online Courses,Köhler D.; Serth S.; Meinel C.,"Köhler, Daniel (57222375304); Serth, Sebastian (57195955075); Meinel, Christoph (56187776800)",57222375304; 57195955075; 56187776800,On Air: Benefits of weekly Podcasts accompanying Online Courses,2023.0,L@S 2023 - Proceedings of the 10th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,311,315,4.0,0.0,10.1145/3573051.3596178,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85167868943&doi=10.1145%2f3573051.3596178&partnerID=40&md5=e138b3caf49ab0349940fad9f0d31bf6,"Hasso-Plattner-Institute, Potsdam, Germany","Köhler D., Hasso-Plattner-Institute, Potsdam, Germany; Serth S., Hasso-Plattner-Institute, Potsdam, Germany; Meinel C., Hasso-Plattner-Institute, Potsdam, Germany",mooc; online education; podcasts; secondary knowledge,E-learning; 'current; Interactivity; Massive open online course; Mooc; On-line education; Online course; Podcasts; Secondary knowledge; Teaching contents; Teaching methods; Teaching,,,,,,,"Adedoyin O.B., Soykan E., Covid-19 pandemic and online learning: The challenges and opportunities, Interactive Learning Environments, pp. 1-13, (2020); Al-Rahmi W.M., Yahaya N., Alamri M.M., Alyoussef I.Y., Al-Rahmi A.M., Kamin Y.B., Integrating innovation diffusion theory with technology acceptance model: Supporting students' attitude towards using a massive open online courses (MOOCs) systems, Interactive Learning Environments, 29, 8, pp. 1380-1392, (2021); Berry R., Will the iPod Kill the Radio Star, Profiling Podcasting as Radio.

Pre-Semester Predictors of Course Retention in a Large Online Graduate CS Program,2023,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"Online education is convenient and accessible, but also brings new challenges to retention. Prior research has found that students in online programs - -including CS programs - -are more likely to withdraw both from individual classes as well as the program as a whole than students in traditional programs. In this study, we delve deeper into retention at the level of individual courses. We analyze three courses offered as part of a large online CS graduate degree program taught at a major research university in the United States. We obtained voluntary data from students across 12 semesters - -including gender, prior CS experience, and anticipated workload for the course - -and analyzed these variables in the context of course retention. While the average course drop rate for the examined courses in the program was 7%, variations in this rate could be predicted by a number of different attributes: for instance, we observed that women, native English speakers, and students with less prior education were allmore likely to complete a course that they had started. Importantly, these predictors can be measured before the class begins, supporting early intervention. © 2023 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,Pre-Semester Predictors of Course Retention in a Large Online Graduate CS Program,Manzak D.; Joyner D.A.,"Manzak, Dilek (57211276876); Joyner, David A.

"Ready or Not, Here I Computer Science: Trends in Preparatory Work Pursued by Incoming Students in an Online Graduate Computer Science Program",2023,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"Research on how students prepare for graduate computer science programs typically focuses on single, subject-specific interventions or relates to preparation for life as a graduate student. Preparatory work completed prior to enrolling in such a program can be particularly important for underrepresented minorities and those without technical backgrounds. We use survey data from incoming students in a large online graduate computer science program to answer three research questions: What are the backgrounds of students entering the program? How do students prepare for the program? And how does student preparation differ based on demographics and prior experience? We find that: male students are more likely than female students to enter the program with computer science qualifications; older students, female students, and those with non-technical degrees are more likely to pursue preparation; and students with no online learning experience are less likely to pursue preparation.

RECIPE: How to Integrate ChatGPT into EFL Writing Education,2023,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"The integration of generative AI in the field of education is actively being explored. In particular, ChatGPT has garnered significant interest, offering an opportunity to examine its effectiveness in English as a foreign language (EFL) education. To address this need, we present a novel learning platform called RECIPE (Revising an Essay with ChatGPT on an Interactive Platform for EFL learners). Our platform features two types of prompts that facilitate conversations between ChatGPT and students: (1) a hidden prompt for ChatGPT to take an EFL teacher role and (2) an open prompt for students to initiate a dialogue with a self-written summary of what they have learned. We deployed this platform for 213 undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in EFL writing courses and seven instructors. For this study, we collect students' interaction data from RECIPE, including students' perceptions and usage of the platform, and user scenarios are examined with the data. We also conduct a focus group interview with six students and an individual interview with one EFL instructor to explore design opportunities for leveraging generative AI models in the field of EFL education. © 2023 ACM.",,,,,,100,RECIPE: How to Integrate ChatGPT into EFL Writing Education,Han J.; Yoo H.; Kim Y.; Myung J.; Kim M.; Lim H.; Kim J.; Lee T.Y.; Hong H.; Ahn S.-Y.; Oh A.,"Han, Jieun (58593604100); Yoo, Haneul (57274452100); Kim, Yoonsu (58183366900); Myung, Junho (58313382000); Kim, Minsun (58313184200); Lim, Hyunseung (57224003254); Kim, Juho (39361826000); Lee, Tak Yeon (54410814200); Hong, Hwajung (34881804800); Ahn, So-Yeon (56856348000); Oh, Alice (35190968400)",58593604100; 57274452100; 58183366900; 58313382000; 58313184200; 57224003254; 39361826000; 54410814200; 34881804800; 56856348000; 35190968400,RECIPE: How to Integrate ChatGPT into EFL Writing Education,2023.0,L@S 2023 - Proceedings of the 10th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,416,420,4.0,1.0,10.1145/3573051.3596200,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85167867058&doi=10.1145%2f3573051.3596200&partnerID=40&md5=3c1ec138138a21d6820fd557626608a6,"KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea","Han J., KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea; Yoo H., KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea; Kim Y., KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea; Myung J., KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea; Kim M., KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea; Lim H., KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea; Kim J., KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea; Lee T.Y., KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea; Hong H., KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea; Ahn S.-Y., KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea; Oh A., KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea",ChatGPT; EFL learners; essay writing; generative AI; learner-ChatGPT interaction,Education computing; ChatGPT; EFL learner; English-as-a-Foreign-Language; Essay writings; Generative AI; Interactive platform; Learner-ChatGPT interaction; Learning platform; Self written; Teacher role; Students,,,,,,,"Ariyanti A., Et al., Technology-Enhanced Paraphrasing Tool to Improve EFL Students' Writing Achievement and Enjoyment, Journal of English Language Teaching and Linguistics (JELTL), 6, 3, pp. 715-726, (2021); Baidoo-Anu D., Ansah L., Education in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI): Understanding the Potential Benefits of ChatGPT in Promoting Teaching and Learning, (2023); Bang Y., Cahyawijaya S., Lee N., Dai W., Su D., Wilie B., Lovenia H., Ji Z., Yu T., Chung W., Do Q.V., Xu Y., Fung P., A Multitask, Multilingual, Multimodal Evaluation of ChatGPT on Reasoning, Hallucination, and Interactivity, (2023); Huang H., Li Z., Taylor L., The Effectiveness of Using Grammarly to Improve Students' Writing Skills, Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Distance Education and Learning (Beijing, China) (ICDEL 2020), pp. 122-127, (2020); Huang W., Hew K.F., Fryer L.K., Chatbots for language learning-Are they really useful.

Rethinking MMLA: Design Considerations for Multimodal Learning Analytics Systems,2023,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"Designing MMLA systems is a complex task requiring a wide range of considerations. In this paper, we identify key considerations that are essential for designing MMLA systems. These considerations include data management, human factors, sensors and modalities, learning scenarios, privacy and ethics, interpretation and feedback, and data collection. The implications of these considerations are twofold: 1) The need for flexibility in MMLA systems to adapt to different learning contexts and scales, and 2) The need for a researcher-centered approach to designing MMLA systems. Unfortunately, the sheer number of considerations can lead to a state of ""analysis paralysis,""where deciding where to begin and how to proceed becomes overwhelming. This synthesis paper asks researchers to rethink the design of MMLA systems and aims to provide guidance for developers and practitioners in the field of MMLA. © 2023 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,Rethinking MMLA: Design Considerations for Multimodal Learning Analytics Systems,Ouhaichi H.;

The [email protected] Eight Years: A Review of Papers and Authors at Learning @ Scale,2023,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"We examine trends in the Learning at Scale conference from 2014 through 2021. We use an original coding scheme to classify all 142 full papers from five angles: setting, approach, pedagogical strategy, population of interest, and dependent variable. We observe a decline of research on MOOCs, an increase in number of settings studied over time, and a consistent focus on assessment strategies. We then examine other conferences to which Learning at Scale authors contribute research. This paper contributes an original coding scheme to classify future Learning at Scale papers; an analysis of the research focuses at Learning at Scale over time; and an evaluation of the mutual influence between Learning at Scale and other venues. These latter two contributions contextualize learning at scale research within Learning at Scale and the broader research community to show how the field has evolved and to help predict its future directions. © 2023 Owner/Author.",,,,,,89,The L@St Eight Years: A Review of Papers and Authors at Learning @ Scale,Duncan A.; Rusch A.; Ravi P.; Joyner D.,"Duncan, Alex (57210732436); Rusch, Ana (58535492500); Ravi, Prerna (57223401838); Joyner, David (35183234600)",57210732436; 58535492500; 57223401838; 35183234600,The L@St Eight Years: A Review of Papers and Authors at Learning @ Scale,2023.0,L@S 2023 - Proceedings of the 10th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,383,387,4.0,0.0,10.1145/3573051.3596192,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85167869001&doi=10.1145%2f3573051.3596192&partnerID=40&md5=020204a7aabdea3833b84e18c53e448d,"College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States; Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States","Duncan A., College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States; Rusch A., College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States; Ravi P., Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States; Joyner D., College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States",future of learning at scale; pedagogical strategy; synthesis,Angle settings; Assessment strategies; Coding scheme; Contextualize; Dependent variables; Future of learning at scale; Pedagogical strategies; Research communities; Research focus; Computer programming,,,,,,,"Chen G., Davis D., Hauff C., Houben G., Learning Transfer: Does It Take Place in MOOCs An Investigation into the Uptake of Functional Programming in Practice, Proceedings of the Third(2016) ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale (L@S '16), pp. 409-418, (2016); Dasgupta S., Hill B.M., Learning to Code in Localized Programming Languages, Proceedings of the Fourth(2017) ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale (L@S '17), pp. 33-39, (2017); Fischer G., Beyond hype and underestimation: Identifying research challenges for the future of MOOCs, Distance Education, 35, 2, pp. 149-158, (2014); Irish I., Finkelberg R., Nkemelu D., Gujrania S., Padiyath A., Raman S., Tailor C., Arriaga R., Starner T., PARQR: Automatic Post Suggestion in the Piazza Online Forum to Support Degree Seeking Online Masters Students, Proceedings of the Seventh ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale (L@S '20), pp. 125-134, (2020); Johanes P., Start of a Science: An Epistemological Analysis of Learning at Scale, Proceedings of the Sixth(2019) ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale (L@S '19), pp. 1-10, (2019); Joyner D., Toward CS1 at scale: Building and testing a MOOC-for-credit candidate, Proceedings of the Fifth Annual ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, pp. 1-10, (2018); Kardan S., Conati C., Providing adaptive support in an interactive simulation for learning: An experimental evaluation, Proceedings of the 33rd Annual ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 3671-3680, (2015); Kent M., Bennett R., What was all that about, Peak MOOC hype and post-MOOC legacies, Massive Open Online Courses and Higher Education: What Went Right, What Went Wrong and Where to Next.

The Use of SMS and Other Mobile Phone-based Messaging to Support Education at Scale: A Synthesis of Recent Evidence,2023,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"Higher levels of device ownership and lower connectivity requirements are key reasons why mobile learning may have potential to support education at scale in low-income contexts. Interest in the use of mobile phones as an educational medium - particularly through the use of SMS or messaging apps - has been renewed recently, as a result of school closures prompted by the Covid-19 pandemic. As a result, the evidence base for educational interventions using SMS at scale has recently expanded. In this work-in-progress synthesis paper, we review recent research studies which have used SMS for education at scale, with findings published since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. We find that there has been a notable increase in studies which have used SMS to promote and support education at a large scale. In addition to its use as a medium for directly supporting learners, it has also been applied to promoting parental engagement and encouraging participation in formal schooling. The efficacy of interventions has been mixed, which highlights the need for nuance and further research as the field looks to understand which benefits of mobile learning could be beneficial to retain post-pandemic. © 2023 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,The Use of SMS and Other Mobile Phone-based Messaging to Support Education at Scale: A Synthesis of Recent Evidence,Jordan K.; Damani K.; Myers C.; Zhao A.,"Jordan, Katy (55314576400); Damani, Kalifa (57226614035); Myers, Christina (57208408234); Zhao, Annette (58314732000)",55314576400; 57226614035; 57208408234; 58314732000,The Use of SMS and Other Mobile Phone-based Messaging to Support Education at Scale: A Synthesis of Recent Evidence,2023.0,L@S 2023 - Proceedings of the 10th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,282,286,4.0,0.0,10.1145/3573051.3596172,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85167868287&doi=10.1145%2f3573051.3596172&partnerID=40&md5=85e0c150166c4c81021afc59adb1a3d6,"University of Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, Cambridge, United Kingdom; Jigsaw Consult, London, United Kingdom; Overseas Development Institute, London, United Kingdom","Jordan K., University of Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, Cambridge, United Kingdom; Damani K., Jigsaw Consult, London, United Kingdom; Myers C., Overseas Development Institute, London, United Kingdom; Zhao A., Jigsaw Consult, London, United Kingdom",educational technology; international development; low- and middle income countries; mobile learning; SMS,Cellular telephones; Educational technology; Message passing; Text messaging; Educational intervention; International development; Low income countries; Low incomes; Middle-income countries; Mobile Learning; Phone-based; Recent researches; Research studies; SMS; E-learning,,,,,"Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, FCDO","We gratefully acknowledge that this work was funded by the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) through the EdTech Hub (http://www.edtechhub.org).","Angrist N., Bergman P., Matsheng M., Distance education strategies to improve learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, Nature Human Behaviour, 6, pp. 913-914, (2022); Arksey H., O'Malley L., Scoping studies: Towards a methodological framework, International Journal of Social Research Methodology, 8, 1, pp. 19-32, (2005); Aurino E., Tsinigo E., Wolf S., Nudges to improve learning and gender parity: Preliminary findings on supporting parent-child educational engagement during Covid-19 using mobile phones, (2022); World Bank country and lending groups, (2023); Beam E., Mukherjee P., Navarro-Sola L., Lowering barriers to remote education: Experimental impacts on parental responses and learning, IZA Discussion Paper 15596, (2022); Bettinger E., Cunha N., Lichand G., Madeira R., Are the effects of informational interventions driven by salience, 350, (2021); Brossard M., Cardoso M., Kamei A., Mishra S., Mizunoya S., Reuge N., Parental engagement in children's learning, Innocenti Research Brief.

Towards Automated Code Assessment with OpenJupyter in MOOCs,2023,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"The popularity of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) as a means of delivering education to large numbers of students has been growing steadily over the last decade. As technology improves, more educational content is becoming readily available to the public. JupyterLab, an open-source web-based interactive development environment (IDE), is also becoming increasingly popular in education, however, it is so far primarily used in small classroom settings. JupyterLab can provide a more interactive, hands-on, and collaborative learning experience for students in MOOCs, and it is highly customizable and can be accessed from anywhere. To capitalize on these benefits, we have developed OpenJupyter, which integrates JupyterLab at scale with MOOCs, enhancing the student learning experience and providing hands-on exercises for data science courses, making them more interactive and engaging. While MOOCs provide access to education for a large number of students, one of the significant challenges is providing effective and timely feedback to learners. OpenJupyter includes an auto-assessment capability that addresses this problem in MOOCs by automating the evaluation process and providing feedback to learners in a timely manner. In this paper, we provide an overview of the architecture of OpenJupyter, its scalability in the context of MOOCs, and its effectiveness in addressing the auto-assessment challenge. We also discuss the Advantages and limitations associated with using OpenJupyter in a MOOC context and provide a reference for educators and researchers who wish to implement similar tools. Our efforts aim to foster an open educational environment in the field of programming by providing learners with an interactive learning tool and a streamlined technical setup, allowing them to acquire and test their knowledge at their own pace. © 2023 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,Towards Automated Code Assessment with OpenJupyter in MOOCs,Elhayany M.; Meinel C.,"Elhayany, Mohamed (57747327800); Meinel, Christoph (56187776800)",57747327800; 56187776800,Towards Automated Code Assessment with OpenJupyter in MOOCs,2023.0,L@S 2023 - Proceedings of the 10th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,321,325,4.0,0.0,10.1145/3573051.3596180,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85167867824&doi=10.1145%2f3573051.3596180&partnerID=40&md5=8a8378b421f56a63df8441b47e749c00,"Hasso Plattner Institute, Potsdam, Germany","Elhayany M., Hasso Plattner Institute, Potsdam, Germany; Meinel C., Hasso Plattner Institute, Potsdam, Germany",auto-assessment; JupyterLab; MOOC; openjupyter; programming,Codes (symbols); Curricula; E-learning; Learning systems; Open source software; Auto-assessment; Automated code; Educational contents; Interactive development environment; Jupyterlab; Massive open online course; Open-source; Openjupyter; Programming; Web based; Students,,,,,,,"Auer M.E., Tsiatsos T., The Challenges of the Digital Transformation in Education: Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Interactive Collaborative Learning (ICL2018)-Volume 2, (2019); Brunner R.J., Kim E.J., Teaching data science, In ICCS 2016, The International Conference on Computational Science.

Towards Game-based Assessment at Scale,2023,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"Games are increasingly being recognized as valuable tools for learning. In addition, they are also being explored for their potential to provide valid and reliable assessments, as they allow to create authentic and engaging assessment contexts through interactive and immersive environments. However, there are challenges to enable Game-based Assessment (GBA) at scale, including the need for interoperability between assessment models and machinery, and the complexity of managing and processing large amounts of data generated by users' interaction with games. In this study, we propose a novel approach that combines the use of ontologies and Big Data technologies for developing interoperable GBAs. The architecture enables assessments to be performed using data from different games, and we also designed and implemented a service API that facilitates the Game-Based Assessment as a Service (GBAaaS) paradigm. GBAaaS simplifies the GBA development process and enables its adoption at scale, making it a promising approach for future developments in this field. © 2023 ACM.",,,,,,100,Towards Game-based Assessment at Scale,Gomez M.J.; Ruipérez-Valiente J.A.; García Clemente F.J.,"Gomez, Manuel J.

Towards Scalable Vocabulary Acquisition Assessment with BERT,2023,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"In this investigation we propose new machine learning methods for automated scoring models that predict the vocabulary acquisition in science and social studies of second grade English language learners, based upon free-form spoken responses. We evaluate performance on an existing dataset and use transfer learning from a large pre-trained language model, reporting the influence of various objective function designs and the input-convex network design. In particular, we find that combining objective functions with varying properties, such as distance among scores, greatly improves the model reliability compared to human raters. Our models extend the current state of the art performance for assessing word definition tasks and sentence usage tasks in science and social studies, achieving excellent quadratic weighted kappa scores compared with human raters. However, human-human agreement still surpasses model-human agreement, leaving room for future improvement. Even so, our work highlights the scalability of automated vocabulary assessment of free-form spoken language tasks in early grades. © 2023 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,Towards Scalable Vocabulary Acquisition Assessment with BERT,Wu Z.; Larson E.; Sano M.; Baker D.; Gage N.; Kamata A.,"Wu, Zhongdi (57725269900); Larson, Eric (55636314693); Sano, Makoto (58535520900); Baker, Doris (36503587000); Gage, Nathan (58535505400); Kamata, Akihito (7003700792)",57725269900; 55636314693; 58535520900; 36503587000; 58535505400; 7003700792,Towards Scalable Vocabulary Acquisition Assessment with BERT,2023.0,L@S 2023 - Proceedings of the 10th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,272,276,4.0,0.0,10.1145/3573051.3596170,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85167869812&doi=10.1145%2f3573051.3596170&partnerID=40&md5=b22930db6042f074b9b2a6e0c67d5df1,"Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX, United States; Mack-the-Psych.com, Tokyo, Setagaya, Japan; University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, United States","Wu Z., Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX, United States; Larson E., Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX, United States; Sano M., Mack-the-Psych.com, Tokyo, Setagaya, Japan; Baker D., University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, United States; Gage N., Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX, United States; Kamata A., Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX, United States",automated scoring; deep neural networks; human-machine reliability; natural language processing; transfer learning,Automation; Large dataset; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Transfer learning; Automated scoring; Human-machine; Human-machine reliability; Language processing; Machine reliability; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Science studies; Transfer learning; Vocabulary acquisition; Deep neural networks,,,,,"Institute of Education Sciences, IES, (R305A140471, R305A200521)","This research was supported, by grants from the Institute of Education Sciences (R305A140471 and R305A200521).

Towards the Identification of Experts in Informal Learning Portals at Scale,2023,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"During the past decade, there has been growing interest among researchers in informal learning at scale, particularly in the area of expert finding. These platforms have played a fundamental role in facilitating informal learning at scale, by providing access to diverse expertise and knowledge resources that might not otherwise be available to learners. Based on the encountered gaps in expert identification in Question & Answer (Q&A) portals, we inspect the feasibility of identifying data science experts in Reddit using the activity behaviour of every user, including Natural Language Processing (NLP), crowdsourced and user features sets. We also examine the impact of using only expert and non-expert classes versus three classes additionally including the out-of-scope class. Our findings can be used for distinguishing different types of users in Reddit, creating a recommendation system, identifying unreliable users or social bots in the early stage and reducing their influence. © 2023 ACM.",,,,,,100,Towards the Identification of Experts in Informal Learning Portals at Scale,Strukova S.; Ruipérez-Valiente J.A.; Gómez Mármol F.,"Strukova, Sofia (57267413700); Ruipérez-Valiente, José A.

Unlocking Financial Success: Empowering Higher Ed Students and Developing Financial Literacy Interventions at Scale,2023,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"Greater financial literacy is critically needed among young adults in the United States [10,35], but many financial literacy education courses have been less effective than hoped for by educators and researchers [7,15]. Additionally, many have not been designed around established curricula or learning science principles, rendering findings difficult for researchers to study empirically [6,34]. In order to better understand the psychosocial mechanisms that predict success in improving learner knowledge and behavior, online educational interventions at scale can be an effective path forward. We conducted interviews with subject matter experts and young adult students to explore the highest priority learning objectives for a brief course curriculum to improve the financial literacy of US young adults. We then leveraged our findings from this study and content from our open-source textbooks to develop the first of several brief online learning interventions for deployment on the large-scale OpenStax Kinetic research infrastructure [2]. In this work-in-progress paper, we discuss the next steps in our research agenda, including course content development and deploying this intervention, as well as our broader plans for our future financial literacy education interventions and translating research into practice with our institutional collaborations. © 2023 ACM.",,,,,,100,Unlocking Financial Success: Empowering Higher Ed Students and Developing Financial Literacy Interventions at Scale,Bradford B.C.; Basu Mallick D.; Baraniuk R.G.,"Bradford, Brittany C.

Utilizing Neural Network to Predict Students Aptitudes for Teaching Assistant Roles,2023,Full Paper,Works-in-Progress,"The emerging field of affordable degrees at scale relies in large part on a linear relationship between the number of students who enroll and the number of teaching assistants who are employed. As programs grow, however, identifying good candidates can become untenable: research has found that the fraction of students who apply for TA roles far exceeds the number of actual available roles, forcing instructors to comb through hundreds of applications for a tiny number of positions. Most of these applicants are themselves former students in the class as well, meaning that there is abundant data from their assignments, grades, peer review behaviors, and forum participation to evaluate candidates, but navigating and using this data requires significant time. In this work, we utilize machine learning to predict students' aptitudes for teaching assistant roles. We train a neural network model on the available data and aggregate meaningful features to determine if a student possesses the qualities associated with being a good TA. This paper covers implementation details of the training dataset, neural network model training, model result and analysis. We also present a verification method and suggest future improvements. © 2023 Owner/Author.",,,,,,100,Utilizing Neural Network to Predict Students Aptitudes for Teaching Assistant Roles,Chrysilla G.N.; Joyner D.,"Chrysilla, Grace Naomi (57211323525); Joyner, David (35183234600)",57211323525; 35183234600,Utilizing Neural Network to Predict Students Aptitudes for Teaching Assistant Roles,2023.0,L@S 2023 - Proceedings of the 10th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale,,,,262,266,4.0,0.0,10.1145/3573051.3596168,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85167866213&doi=10.1145%2f3573051.3596168&partnerID=40&md5=6bbfe1c038c931bb9c99ebeeb9467b1a,"Computer Science, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States","Chrysilla G.N., Computer Science, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States; Joyner D., Computer Science, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States",artificial intelligence; distance learning; education; higher education; machine learning; neural network; online learning; teaching assistant,Application programs; E-learning; Education computing; Learning systems; Machine learning; Distance-learning; Forcings; High educations; Large parts; Linear relationships; Machine-learning; Neural network model; Neural-networks; Online learning; Teaching assistants; Students,,,,,,,"Huffmyer A.S., Lemus U.D., Graduate TA teaching behaviors impact student achievement in a research-based undergraduate science course, Journal of College Science Teaching, 48, 3, pp. 56-65; Boyle P., Boice B., Systematic Mentoring for New Faculty Teachers and Graduate Teaching Assistants, Innovative Higher Education, 22, pp. 157-179; Liu W., Chawla S., Class Confidence Weighted NN Algorithms for Imbalanced Data Sets, (2011); Badirli S., Liu X., Xing Z., Gradient Boosting Neural Network: GrowNet, (2020)",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",ACM,"10th ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale, L@S 2023",20 July 2023 through 22 July 2023,Copenhagen,190884.0,,979-840070025-5,,,English,L@S - Proc.
